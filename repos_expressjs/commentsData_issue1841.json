This is a dep on connect. It seems the latest version of connect (2.9.0) is pulling in the correct dependency. However express lists the connect version as 2.11.2, not sure how that is possible. However with current version of express this bug fix is not included.\n\namitaibu/node-multiparty@37c25c9#commitcomment-4241353\n\n—\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n",
