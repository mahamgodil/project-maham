    "body": "> It doesn't require anything in the node/npm ecosystem.\n\nI assume you mean Make. True, but it does require something of your development environment that isn't universal (Make itself). Being able to pull in all your development, deployment, testing, etc. dependencies with a single command (`npm install`) is a powerful thing IMO.\n\nMaybe its a mindset thing. I'm biased towards less typing; I like being able to execute `cmd arg` vs. `npm run cmd arg`. Its kind of a \"do more to do less\" argument. I fully admit that's pretty pretty thin ice, though.\n\n@defunctzombie, the same could be said for sufficiently complex make files, but point taken. \n\nAnyway, thanks all. Curious sated. \n",

The JS community is large; I find it to be a useful tool, but before this thread I didn't know how divided people were about it.\n\n@rlidwka I'll try to find some time later today to write a couple examples. Hopefully it will lead to some interesting discussion.\n",

Then I got lazy. Either way, I think writing commands in plain javascript is easier than using grunt plugins and tinkering with their endless options.\n",
