    "body": "Hi @CullenShane , the `req.params` property is only populated in the middleware/handler that has those parameters defined on the path. I assume you defined your error handler with no parameters (`app.use((err, res, res, next) => ...)` vs `app.use('/:param1', (err, req, res, next) => ...)` which is why the `req.params` is empty, due to the error handler having no parameters defined.\r\n\r\nBut ultimately, without providing the full code and instructions for how to reproduce the issue, we're just making guesses, so not 100% sure if the behavior you are experiencing is expected vs unexpected. If you can provide a reproduceable test-case we can run to see the issue demonstrated, we can make an accurate evaluation.",

    "body": "hi @dougwilson - thanks for taking a look and thanks for all the work you do (and have done over the years) maintaining express and friends 🙏:pray::pray:\r\n\r\n@CullenShane and i were pairing on this one earlier so i figured i'd chime in w/ more detail. \r\n\r\nbasically, we have a fairly simple app that runs some middleware for all routes to capture data after a response is finished:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst onFinished = require('on-finished');\r\nmodule.exports = ({ logFoo }) => {\r\n    return (req, res, next) => {\r\n        onFinished(res, () => logFoo(req.params.foo));\r\n        next();\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which hosts an endpoint like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get('/v1/stuff/:foo/config', configFooStuff);\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which ultimately calls `res.format()` like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconfigFooStuff(req, res) {\r\n    res.format({\r\n        'application/json': async () => {\r\n            //...\r\n        },\r\n        'application/schema+json': () => {\r\n            //...\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen the `Accept` header specifies something we aren't handling (e.g. `text/html`), we end up with `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'params' of undefined`. when handling a format we do support (e.g. `application/json`), `req.params` is an object w/ a valid `.foo` property and everything works as expected. further, if we add an explicit `default` handler to our `res.format()` call - e.g.:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n'default': () => {\r\n    res.status(406).json({ error: 'Not Acceptable' });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...things work but `req.params` is an empty object.\r\n\r\nso the main question is why would `req.params` be `undefined` when `res.format()` doesn't use a `default` handler? willing to bet we're just missing something given how exercised this code must be but 🤷‍♂️\r\n\r\nthanks again!\r\n\r\nedit: fix typos and minor derpage 🤦 ",

    "body": "> req.params is undefined when we expected it always at least be an empty object.\r\n\r\nAh, thank you, that does help 👍 . I can say, at least, that `req.params` will always be `undefined` when the request cycle is not currently \"in\" a middleware or handler in Express. This means that when the request first comes in from Node.js it will be undefined, and also during any \"in between time\" between middlewares. When a request enters a middleware/handler, before user code is executed, Express will set up `req.params` property, but once that middleware/handler calls `next()` or throws an error, the property is removed so the next middleware/handler can populate it, if needed.\r\n\r\nIt will always be an object if the request is actively \"in\" a middleware/handler, even if it's an empty object. Since it is `undefined` for you, it means (assuming there is not some code actually setting it to `undefined` somewhere) that the request is not inside a middleware/handler of Express at all... which would be strange based on your description above.",

Once it leaves the handler and re-enters into the routing system, `req.params` is cleared in order to populate again for the next route. In order for a request/response to have reached the default error handler, it had to have left a handler (or never entered one) and gone back into the routing system.",
