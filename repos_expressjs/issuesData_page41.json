    "body": "It seems like the routes are bound to the middleware stack in the state that it was at the moment the first route was created, which creates hard to track sequential coupling for complex initialization processes.\n\nGiven the lightweight/kiss nature of express, I understand that this _might_ be done by design. However, I'd advise documenting the exact behavior clearly. (ie: That the middleware stack bound to a route corresponds to the state of the middleware stack at the moment where the first route was created.)\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n``` javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar should = require('should');\n\n// Create express app;\nvar app = express.createServer();\n\n// Route here, which fails\napp.get('/', function(req,res){\n  // We *should* receive the value here given the custom middleware\n  // was supposed to have put it.\n  should.exist(req._magic); \n  return res.send('Hello World!');\n});\n\n// Middleware stack\n//Small mw setting a custom var in the req for the tests.\napp.use(function(req,res,next){req._magic = '42';next();});\napp.use(app.router); //Router right there\n\n// Another route, defined after the mw stack. it will also fail.\napp.get('/test', function(req,res){\n  should.exist(req._magic); \n  return res.send('Hello World!');\n});\n\n// Start server\napp.listen(3000);\n\n\n```\n\nMove the middleware stack above all the routes definition to get it all working. \n\nI'm on express 2.5.2\n",

    "body": "Hey guys, \n\nI am currently following this guide to allow socket.io to read express session storage: http://www.danielbaulig.de/socket-ioexpress/\n\nBasically, I am using express.session.MemoryStore for session memory, and exposing that in a global variable that i can refer to in other places such as socket.io (for authentication)\n\nHowever, the problem arise when i try to run the app in NODE_ENV=production, the app gives me the following warning:\n\nWarning: connection.session() MemoryStore is not\ndesigned for a production environment, as it will leak\nmemory, and obviously only work within a single process.\n\nAnyone have any idea of how to properly resolve this?\n\nThanks a lot :)\n\nJason\n",

And, the last javascript file is login.js.\n\nWhen these files are rendered into the browser, their contents are injected with the contents of the dom for the app:\n\n`<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title> Login</title><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/stylesheets/reset.css\"><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/stylesheets/text.css\"><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/stylesheets/960.css\"><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/stylesheets/validationEngine.jquery.css\"><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/stylesheets/main.css\"><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/stylesheets/login.css\"><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.0/jquery.min.js\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/javascripts/jquery.validationEngine.js\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/javascripts/login.js\"></script></head><body><div class=\"main_nav\"><div class=\"container_12\"><div class=\"grid_12\"><ul id=\"main_nav\"><li class=\"nav left first\"><a href=\"/\" title=\"\" class=\"selected\">Home</a></li><li class=\"nav left\"><a href=\"/pricing\" title=\" Pricing\">Pricing</a></li><li class=\"nav left\"><a href=\"/docs\" title=\" Docs\">Docs</a></li><li class=\"nav left\"><a href=\"/support\" title=\" Support\">Support</a></li><li class=\"nav left\"><a href=\"/jobs\" title=\" Jobs\">Jobs</a></li><li class=\"nav left\"><a href=\"/blog\" title=\" Blog\">Blog</a></li><li class=\"nav left\"><a href=\"/signup\" title=\" Signup\">Signup</a></li><li class=\"nav right\"><a href=\"/login\" title=\" Login\" class=\"login\">Login</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"clear\"></div></div></div></body><body><div class=\"container_12\"><div class=\"grid_3\">&#160;\n</div><div id=\"login_box\" class=\"grid_6\"><div class=\"login_box\"><form action=\"requestLogin\" method=\"put\" id=\"login\"><span class=\"in_block left_column\">Username:\n</span><span class=\"in_block right_column\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" maxlength=\"100\" class=\"text validate[required]\" id=\"username\"/>\n</span><br/><span class=\"in_block left_column\">Password:\n</span><span class=\"in_block right_column\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"password\" maxlength=\"100\" class=\"text validate[required]\" id=\"password\"/>\n</span><br/><span class=\"in_block left_column\"></span><span class=\"in_block text_wrapper\"><input name=\"rememberMe\" type=\"checkbox\"/>&#160; Remember Me?\n</span><br/><span class=\"in_block left_column\"></span><span class=\"in_block right_column\"><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign In\" class=\"button\"/></span><br/><span class=\"in_block left_column\"></span><span class=\"in_block text_wrapper\">Forgot your password?\n<a href=\"recoverCredentials\">Recover it here. </a></span><div class=\"openId\">Or sign in with:\n<a href=\"\"><img src=\"/images/google_openId.png\" style=\"display:inline-block;padding:0px 8px\"/></a><a href=\"\"><img src=\"/images/yahoo_openId.png\"/></a></div><div class=\"promoteUs\"><div>Help spread the word about \n</div><div><div data-href=\"http://www..com\" data-send=\"true\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"200\" data-show-faces=\"true\" class=\"fb-like\"></div></div></div></form></div><div id=\"small_logo\" class=\"grid_2 alpha\"><a href=\"http://www..com\"><img src=\"/images/logo_small.png\"/></a></div><div id=\"legals\" class=\"grid_4 omega\"><a href=\"http://www..com/support\">Support </a>&#160;|\n<a href=\"http://www..com/terms\">Terms &amp; Conditions </a>&#160;|\n<a href=\"http://www..com/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a><br/>&#169; 2011, ABC, Inc.\n</div></div><div class=\"grid_3\">&#160;\n</div><div class=\"clear\"></div></div></body></html>`\n\nIt appears that Express or Stylus is injecting the dom into files with the same name as the Jade route file. If I name/rename the files and links something else, this problem doesn't occur.\n",

    "body": "I'm trying to run both HTTP and HTTPS servers as described in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/1051583).\n\nIt all runs fine until it hits the last auto-generated `console.log` which invokes `app.address().port`, throwing the following error:\n\n```\nTypeError: Bad file descriptor argument\n    at HTTPServer.address (net.js:1129:10)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/mtam/test/app.js:52:67)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:411:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:417:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:343:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:302:12)\n    at Array.<anonymous> (module.js:430:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:126:26)\n```\n\nThe servers run perfectly if I remove that line.\n\nA couple things:\n1. Is `app.address()` documented somewhere?\n2. What's a good way to check if an incoming request is HTTP or HTTPS? I wanted to use `app.address().port`, but that crashed; I see some HTTPS-specific variables in `req`, but depending on that seems unreliable.\n\nThanks!\n",

This pushes more work on the\nengine but ultimately a bit more flexibility for the engine as well.\n\nAlso since `.render()` is so common we should probably go with\nsomething ugly like `engine.__render(filename...)`\n\nWe also have the choice of doing _some_ lookup, for example\nallowing `index.<engine>` files so you can do `res.render('user')`\nfor _./views/user.jade_ or _./views/user/index.jade_,\nor leave this entirely to the engine as well.\n",

I might be a complete idiot, but I think dynamic helpers should NOT take precedence over route-specific locals (i.e. locals passed directly to `res.render()`.  As of right now, I believe this is the case... running Express 2.x or whatever is currently in npm.\n\nI'm of the opinion that dynamic view helpers are to be used only when a view accesses a local var that would otherwise be unavailable...\n\nThoughts?\n",
