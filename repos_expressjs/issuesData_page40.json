    "body": "Some steps to reproduce (in Express v2.5.8)\n\n1) Create a new project with session support (what I did)\n2) Add a route that saves something to req.session (Memory)\n3) pass that value to res.render () to a view that contains a partial for the type saved in the session. In my example:\n\nsome code:\n\napp.js\n\n```\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n    req.session.user = {username:'dan', password:'ASDF'};\n    res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });\n});\n\napp.get('/test', function (req, res) {\n    res.render(\"test.jade\", {title:'test', user:req.session.user});\n});\n```\n\ntest.jade\n\n```\np User details:\n!= partial('user', user)\n```\n\n_user.partial\n\n```\np User Partial : #{user.username}, - #{user.password}\n```\n\nInitially, I got the following when trying to render the view, test.jade: \n\n```\nnode.js:201\n        throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick\n          ^\nTypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON\n    at Object.stringify (native)\n    at Array.0 (/home/dan/development/aqp/node_modules/express/node_modules/connect/lib/middleware/session    /memory.js:77:31)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:192:40)\n```\n\nafter some digging, I found that I narrowed this down to renderPartial() in express/lib/view.js.\n\nThe problem, as I understand it, is that because parentLocals (in this case the session?) appears to be utils.union()'ed with the partial's object, user, causing a circular reference.\n\nI am willing to admit that I am pretty new to node.js in general, so I could really just be using the tools wrong.\n",

    "body": "So I've been trying to figure this out for a few hours, forgive my naivete.\n\nWhen using connect's [MemoryStore](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/middleware-session-memory.html), (yeh, yeh I should be using redis, this is educational only.) Where is the Session stored?\n\nIf you don't assign a variable to it... and allow Express to initialize the default MemoryStore\n\n```\napp.use(express.session({ secret: \"keyboard cat\" }));\n```\n\nHow do you access the _MemoryStore_ ? Anything like, _server.routes.session.store_ ?\n\nI know you can access it with _req.sessionStore_, but I'm trying to access it with only the _server_ variable. So my follow-up question is how do you simulate a request, or does Express have anyway to do \"fake\" requests? Like...\n\n```\nserver.runFake(function(req, res){\nreq.blah  // Do some req/res stuff\nconsole.log(res...)\n});\n\n// ...or...\n\nconsole.log(server.request)  // Request object ?\nconsole.log(server.response)  // Response object ?\n\n```\n\n---\n\nBasically, must I have to do something like...\n\n``` javascript\nserver = express.createServer({...})\n\nserver.get('/delete', function(req, res){\n req.sessionStore.clear()\n});\n\nrequire('superagent').get('http://localhost:3000/delete')\n```\n\njust to clear the sessions, with default _MemoryStore_, or is there a better way?\n\nThank You!\n",

And then the _mother app_ that sets things up for all the children apps.\n\nSo, for this reason I'd like a way to inherit the `res.locals`. Since everything added to `req` is passed on nicely, I at least, expected changes to `res` to work similar. \n\nAnyway I've written a little self contained example of what I'd like to work: https://gist.github.com/1767058\n\n`npm install -g git://github.com/visionmedia/express.git jade && node test-express.js` should do the trick ;)\n\nIf there's a workaround to the current behaviour somehow that would be enough for me too. \n",

This is important for deployment where you want to be sure the same versions are running on all your deployed systems. Using >= is not good since different library authors might have different ideas about what is a breaking change. It also causes a disconnect between potentially deployed versions (if you push out to a new system and a newer version of the dependent library is used).\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI stumbled upon your awsome project and I found out that this is great project to have play around. Everything great except I found little missing part inside view. It has missing on defining section inside template. Here is the simple overview on the problem:\n\nI am using view engine, HBS. I defined the layout and the view for each routes.\nlayout.hbs:\n\n``` html\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>title</title>\n    {{#section \"head\" context}}\n      {{{body}}}\n    {{/section}}\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    {{{body}}}\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAnd this is the view for each routes:\n# index.hbs:\n\n``` html\n{{#define \"head\" context}}\n<script>alert(\"hola!\")</script>\n{{/define}}\n\n<span>this is child HTML</span>\n```\n\nnote that, I have two custom helpers inside HBS template, what they are:\n- section: a placeholder inside layout HBS to display what defined inside child HBS\n- define: ability to register what is the HTML to be rendered inside section\n# app.js to define the helpers functions\n\n``` html\n// views\n// this is small hack to hold all the HTML but well... :)\nhbs.sections = [];\n\n// register helper for parent to hold the section\nhbs.registerHelper(\"section\", function(name, context, fn)\n{\n  // make sure context is defined\n  context = (!_.isArray(context)) ? [] : context;\n  // register the body into the template\n  context[\"body\"] = hbs.sections[name];\n  // render it\n  return fn(context);\n});\n// register helper for child to define the section\nhbs.registerHelper(\"define\", function(name, context, fn)\n{\n  // register the pre-compiled HTML inside child\n  hbs.sections[name] = fn(context);\n  // make sure return nothing\n  return \"\";\n});\n```\n\nIs that possible to roll this out inside your view engine? Across all other view type, jade, ejs, etc... I found it is possible inside HBS but I am not sure with other. I hope this will help other who is having the same difficulty that I have. Enjoy!\n",

The problem seems to occur on libraries written as anonymous functions: e.g. (function (var1, var2){somthing})().  I do not have the same problems for css files and this only occurs with libraries i have downloaded locally (my custom javascript files load with no problem).  Debugging to me, it seems it is looking for an end of file and waiting for this?\n\nTo reproduce - try to load something like Jquery in your template locally rather than from the CDN as follows:\n\nIn the layout.mustache\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/default.css\" media=\"screen\" />\n<title>{{title}}</title>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/jquery-1.7.1.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n{{{yield}}}\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nin the view.mustache\n\n```\n<p>Page will not load until 2 min when script load times out</p>\n```\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information to reproduce.  Any tips or help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI started to create an app with Express.js and I discovered that Step might be broken if you want to use it inside of Express.\n\nExample:\n\n``` javascript\nvar express = require(\"express\");\nvar step    = require(\"step\");\n\nvar app = express.createServer();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res)\n{\n    step(\n        function one()\n        {\n            console.log(\"one\");\n\n            if (true)\n                return res.send(\"one\");\n\n            this();\n        },\n        function two()\n        {\n            console.log(\"two\");\n\n            res.send(\"two\");\n        }\n    );\n});\n\napp.listen(8080, function() {\n    console.log(\"App is running on port 8080\");\n});\n```\n\nIf you run this example and go in your browser to `http://localhost:8080` this is what you get:\n\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/283I0s252W0H471E2U1U/Screen%20Shot%202011-12-29%20at%2011.46.42.png)\n\nAs you can see in the code, the output \"two\" actually never should be happen because the first function inside of step should always return.\n\nIt seems to me if Express is calling `this()`somehow when calling `res.send()`\n",
