    "body": "Using `router.use` seems to be documented to allow you to add middleware that will only be called for routes added to that router, but that does not seem to be working for me. The issue seems to be because I'm mounting several routers at the same path. The decision for whether a middleware is run seems to be based on the path, not the router. This was confusing.\n\nThe use case here is that my application has several modules that are mounted under the same location, as the URLs for these don't always follow a common prefix. There's common middleware that is used on most, but not all, endpoints. I was attempting to refactor the application to use an express.Router for each module, with each router being able to .use whatever middleware is common to all of its routes.\n\nThe result has been that the same middleware is called multiple times, because several routers are all using it. They should be separated, if Router worked as described. Another case is that one module used a middleware to require auth on all of the endpoints in its router, but that spilled over to any other routers used after that one.\n\nIs this intended behavior? Is there a workaround?\n\nHere is a Gist demonstrating the issue: https://gist.github.com/mjm/497a23f68826f8ca473b\n",

    "body": "This is a discussion regarding having Express 5.0 drop support for Node.js 0.10. One of the reasons for the delay in Express 5.0 was the announcement of the official merging of Node.js and io.js, and we were looking forward to it's outcome to determine what we should do with Express 5.0.\n\nHere at Express, we value very long-lived major versions, allowing users to confidentially build their new server on Express and not have to worry about needing to upgrade across a major, breaking change for years. Express 4.0 has been out for over a year now and Express 3.0 was supported for over 3 years !!\n\nWhen Express 5.0 comes out, Express 4.x line will continue to be fully supported, delivering our users bug fixes, new features, and more!\n\nTo this end, we have been carefully watching io.js/Node.js in relation to Express 5.0 such that we can continue this great support history without accidentally locking us into the past for a long time.\n\nPlease share your thoughts here.\n",

When I use `express.static('public')` in `sub.js`, it refers to `/public`, not `/sub/public`, even if the code is in `sub.js`. I was confused and spent quite some time on this behavior, so I hope you can give some explanation to this behavior on the doc, so in the future people won't get confused.\n",

    "body": "Hello - this pull request is in response to #2745 \n\nI was writing an express app that bound to any address on port 5000.  (*:5000)\n\nIt needed to receive POSTs from anywhere, but only serve GETs from local connections (localhost).  I thought it would be nice if express had getters on the request object to test if the connecting client is localhost, on the lan, or from the greater internet.\n\nI defined getters for: `request.local`, `request.inside`, and `request.outside`\n\nI intended for it to be used like:\n\n``` javascript\napp.get('/', function (req, res, next) { if (req.local) next(); }, ...);\n```\n\nThis isn't meant to be as complete as express-ipfilter.\n\n`request.local` - coming from localhost\n`request.inside` - coming from LAN\n`request.outside` - coming from ... not-LAN (lol)\n\nConsiderations / Acknowledgements:\n\n1) I took what I needed from the node-ip module: https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/blob/master/lib/ip.js#L261\n  I tried to rewrite the regular expressions there so they were more concise/readable.  It's assumed that we're getting a valid IP from `request.ip` - but the getter for `request.ip` may take into account the x-requested-for header if 'trust proxy' is enabled.  In my opinion we don't need to be certain it's a valid IP, so these expressions can be more concise/minimal.\n\n2) I am hoping this is a complete list of private subnets.  I followed what I found in the node-ip module and what was on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network\n\n3) I had trouble coming up with names for these getters.  I initially wanted `request.private` and `request.public`, but because they're so close to common language keywords I avoided it.  I'm still not happy with `request.local`, but I feel it 'passes'.\n\n4) It might be poor separation of concerns to have this as part of express' core.  I originally used node-ip to do: `app.get('/', function (req, res, next) { if (require(ip).isPrivate(req.ip)) next(); })` which isn't much longer than what I'm proposing.  I looked at the source for node-ip and I wasn't very happy with how it was written.  I saw that those 3 functions weren't dependent on the rest of the module so it also felt like something express could offer by itself.  I was also bored so I thought I'd make the pull request anyway. :-)\n\nTahh!\n\nPS: I am somewhat worried I am fetching the ip wrong in these getters.  I'm also hoping I kept to the formatting style of express.\n",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nCurrently I have an express app that accepts POSTs sent by Github with a secret token to let me know when changes to a project happen.  The app saves these requests to output again in their original JSON form for GET requests.\n\nThe problem is I have no easy way to restrict it so I'm only serving GET requests locally - I don't want to serve any remote requests.  I've been searching for a library to test if the IP address of the connecting client is local or remote, but it's been hard to find a module that does what I want.\n\nFurthermore, because an express app might be operating behind a proxy it feels like it should also take into account req.headers['x-forwarded-for'] and such.\n\nTo me, this feels like something that should be abstracted away by express or in middleware.  I really like the express api and handling this doesn't feel clean, I was surprised it wasn't easy (unless I'm missing something in the docs?).  I'd like to test either request.local or request.remote in a middleware function.\n\nPlease and thank you?\n\nPS: If this were middleware and not part of the core express, I'd also like to test if the connecting client is in a subnet.  Like: app.use(subnet('127.0.0.0/8'))  I didn't trust myself to write this handling both IPv4 and IPv6.\n",

If this is on purpose, can anyone share the concept behind this? Thanks a lot.\n",

    "body": "Hi there,\nI'm using Express for what I imagine to be a large project, and I have many href links inside my views. I **do not** want to hardcode them at all! Any time I change something I must go and search in the code in order to make it work.\n\n_Short story_: how can I track back a route, so I can use this in views:\n\n``` html\n<a href=\"{{ url('route_id') }} /> <!-- // as you don't mind what the template engine is -->\n```\n\n_Long one_: I've searched for a day about routing in Express and I found a few \"reverse\" routing packages, ALL of them quite broken - they either don't work with `Router()` or they create new Router every time, etc.\nI got to know all the Layers and stacks that the Routing part creates. I understand that you guys want order in routes, as well as multiple handlers for the same path. I agree with all that.\n\nBut isn't there some easy way to add ids for those routes? I found that if I simply use\n\n``` js\napp.use('/path', function namedFunction(req, res, next) {});\n```\n\nI get `namedFunction` as a name of the Layer in the stack, which is great. But if I use router (like `router.route('/path').get(...).post(...)`, then the Layer is named `router` and inner stack contains `anonymous` functions.\n\nMy idea here was that after I add all routes, I can browse `app._router` and it's stacks, getting names of routes, then using a function with name parameter so I can construct back a route.\n\nAm I missing something, or there is **no** way to make this easy working? I can't imagine someone having 100+ routes in a project, that hardcodes their links inside it - I just refuse to think of it :)\n",

However when it is does not send it either (which is all res.json ends up doing in the end). If I get a chance to trace what is happening in send I will reply back with the actual cause.\n\nAnyway - doing absolutely nothing and not generating a response doesn't seem to be good behavior.\n",

    "body": "We've been exploiting the `mount` event for years to gain access to the parent app from a piece of \"middleware\". I've termed this pattern the ephemeral app pattern and we use it extensively in the [krakenjs org](https://github.com/krakenjs) (for example, in [kraken-js, itself](https://github.com/krakenjs/kraken-js/blob/64f764160ee8491141960fc7755fdf05e7ae6776/index.js#L48-L92)).\n\nThis pattern works well except for in one case: route-normalization. In one of our modules, we [munge the mountpath and try to normalize it with other `route` suffixes](https://github.com/krakenjs/meddleware/blob/06fb02387b14471368d605df0da5d8a3eb7d44a5/index.js#L208-L214). This works moderately well in the general case, however it falls down when dealing with regular expressions. In those cases, [we simply don't do anything](https://github.com/krakenjs/meddleware/blob/06fb02387b14471368d605df0da5d8a3eb7d44a5/index.js#L164-L167).\n\nTo get around this issue, I started creating a version of [meddleware](https://github.com/krakenjs/meddleware) that mounted on a `Router` instead of on the parent app instance. The benefit there was that we wouldn't have to try to normalize the routes, we could just use the `mountpath` for the router -> app mount point, and `spec.route` as the middleware -> router mount point.\n\nProblem with that, however, is that the `Router` instances don't emit themselves out to mounted functions the way that App instances do. I understand it's for setting up [trust proxy and prototype chains](https://github.com/strongloop/express/blob/2f8ac6726fa20ab5b4a05c112c886752868ac8ce/lib/application.js#L88-L101)(something Router's need not worry about) but it sure is handy. :)\n\nI could certainly change all of this in my app code but wanted to see if you'd entertain creating an analogous event for routers.\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nA small addon for the express.static. \n\nI was searching for an option to ignore files from being served by the static express module. Especially unminified or untreated js && css files. \n\nI have made some modification to the /express/node_modules/send/index.js to ignore file with the extension \".sec.js\" or \"sec.css\"\n\nUSAGE \n\n---\n\nsecfiles\n\nSet how \"secfiles\" are treated when encountered. A secfiles is a file that end by dot (\".sec.css\") or (\".sec.js\")   Note this check is done on the path itself without checking if the path actually exists on the disk. \n\nThe default value is 'ignore'.\n\n'allow' No special treatment for secfiles.\n'deny' Deny a request for a secfile and 403/next().\n'ignore' Pretend like the secfile does not exist and 404/next().\n\n---\n\nMinified file are normaly served with the extension \".sec.min.js\" or \"sec.min.css\".\n\nMaybe this modification can be integrate in futur version.\n\nYou can find my modification below : \n\nAnd also thank from France for your job on express and strongloop!\n\n``` js\n/*!\n * send\n * Copyright(c) 2012 TJ Holowaychuk\n * Copyright(c) 2014-2015 Douglas Christopher Wilson\n * MIT Licensed\n */\n\n'use strict'\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n * @private\n */\n\nvar createError = require('http-errors')\nvar debug = require('debug')('send')\nvar deprecate = require('depd')('send')\nvar destroy = require('destroy')\nvar escapeHtml = require('escape-html')\n  , parseRange = require('range-parser')\n  , Stream = require('stream')\n  , mime = require('mime')\n  , fresh = require('fresh')\n  , path = require('path')\n  , fs = require('fs')\n  , normalize = path.normalize\n  , join = path.join\nvar etag = require('etag')\nvar EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;\nvar ms = require('ms');\nvar onFinished = require('on-finished')\nvar statuses = require('statuses')\n\n/**\n * Variables.\n */\nvar extname = path.extname\nvar maxMaxAge = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 1000; // 1 year\nvar resolve = path.resolve\nvar sep = path.sep\nvar toString = Object.prototype.toString\nvar upPathRegexp = /(?:^|[\\\\\\/])\\.\\.(?:[\\\\\\/]|$)/\n\n/**\n * Module exports.\n * @public\n */\n\nmodule.exports = send\nmodule.exports.mime = mime\n\n/**\n * Shim EventEmitter.listenerCount for node.js < 0.10\n */\n\n/* istanbul ignore next */\nvar listenerCount = EventEmitter.listenerCount\n  || function(emitter, type){ return emitter.listeners(type).length; };\n\n/**\n * Return a `SendStream` for `req` and `path`.\n *\n * @param {object} req\n * @param {string} path\n * @param {object} [options]\n * @return {SendStream}\n * @public\n */\n\nfunction send(req, path, options) {\n  return new SendStream(req, path, options);\n}\n\n/**\n * Initialize a `SendStream` with the given `path`.\n *\n * @param {Request} req\n * @param {String} path\n * @param {object} [options]\n * @private\n */\n\nfunction SendStream(req, path, options) {\n  var opts = options || {}\n\n  this.options = opts\n  this.path = path\n  this.req = req\n\n  this._etag = opts.etag !== undefined\n    ?

    "body": "Currently, `res.links` allows to only add a single link per rel per call. One can add multiple link with the same rel through calling `res.links` multiple times. #2575 would also allow to add multiple links with the same call. Both of these methods are, however, quite cumbersome when one wants to simply add multiple links with the same rel and without optional parameters.\n\nA possible alternative would be to allow the following:\n\n``` js\nres.links({\n  self: '/a',\n  item: ['/a/0', '/a/1']\n})\n```\n\nNote that this would currently result in `Link: </a>; rel=\"self\", </a/0,/a/1>; rel=\"item\"`, which is incorrect - the path may contain commas, so /a/0,/a/1 is a single path. The expected result would be `Link: </a>; rel=\"self\", </a/0>; rel=\"item\", </a/1>; rel=\"item\"`.\n",

In our work, we consider that a system is in trouble if more than 50% of its files become orphan (i.e., without a main author).\n\nMore details on our work in this preprint: https://peerj.com/preprints/1233\n\nWe calculated the TF for **express** and obtained a value of **2**.\n\nThe developers responsible for this TF are:\n\nTJ Holowaychuk - author of 71% of the files\nDouglas Christopher Wilson - author of 25% of the files\n\nTo validate our results, we would like to ask **express** developers the following three brief questions:\n\n(a) Do you agree that the listed developers are the main developers of **express**?\n\n(b) Do you agree that **express** will be in trouble if the listed developers leave the project (e.g., if they win in the lottery, to be less morbid)?\n\n(c) Does **express** have some characteristics that would attenuate the loss of the listed developers (e.g., detailed documentation)?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGuilherme Avelino\nPhD Student\nApplied Software Engineering Group (ASERG)\nUFMG, Brazil\nhttp://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/\n",

Am I missing some point here?\n",

    "body": "I was trying to use Express to render `*.jade` files with jade and `*.htm` files with a different view engine (nunjucks in this case).\n\nThis [SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15063262/is-there-any-way-to-use-multiple-view-engines-with-express-node-js) led me to believe that using [`app.engine`](http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.engine) would be the ticket.\n\nI thought that after setting up multiple app.engines, I would be able to call `res.render('./views/hello.jade', ...);` or `res.render('./views/hello.htm', ...);` and each call would render with a different view engine. However it's not working for me, so I'm resorting to rendering HTML strings and sending them with `res.send`.\n\nIs there an example that shows the supported way to use multiple engines in Express? If not, maybe I'm misunderstanding the point of app.engine.\n\nHere's basically what I tried (paraphrased). I don't like it at all, so I'm probably going to stick with my own code that decides which view engine to use based on the file system's file extension.\n\n``` javascript\n// Setup\napp.set('views', './src');\napp.set('view engine', 'jade');\napp.locals = someContext;\napp.engine('jade', jade.__express);\napp.engine('htm', nunjucks.render);\n// ...\napp.get('*', function(req, res, next) {\n   // Try to render with .jade first, if that doesn't work, try .htm.\n  var viewpath = getJadeTemplatePath(req.path); // So, a request for hello/ will try hello.jade first.\n  res.render(viewpath, function(err, html) {\n      // Code not shown: If err except \"template not found\" errors, call next(err)\n      // Code not shown: If no error, call res.send(html);\n      // Otherwise, keep searching...\n      var viewpath = getNunjucksTemplatePath(req.path);\n      res.render(viewpath, function(err, html) {\n        // more attempts for hello/index.jade and hello/index.htm...\n      });\n  });\n}\n```\n",

So for the url `/hello?url=google.com` you get an error because it's looking for the module `com`.\n\nYou can enable periods in react-engine simply by commenting out [this line](https://github.com/strongloop/express/blob/master/lib/view.js#L57). I'm putting in a pull request to copy the whole `View` with this line commented but it would be great if express supported it.\n\nIs there a way to do this already?\n",

    "body": "Hello nice people,\n\nWhen developing an application that has HEAD handlers and using `curl` to test those routes, curl will hang on the response at times if the request handler doesn't explicitly `res.send('')`.\n\nIt looks like it hangs because express will set a content-length based on the content that is used in `res.send(<whatever>)` to generate a content-length header, and curl will wait for that number of bytes before considering the response complete.  Note that the old deprecated `res.send(200)` has default text that will also generate a non-zero content length.\n\nA workaround is to tell curl to ignore the body of the response with `curl -I` but this may not help other client implementations that don't expect to see a content-length that does not match the response body length.\n\nAnother workaround is code your application to have `app.head` handlers explicitly `res.send('')`\n\nOne question I have is around the etag generation.  This change will break the current behavior of the etag plugin because it changes the signature of the etag between a head request and a get request.  I'm not sure how others use etags, so this might be a breaking change for some use cases.\n\nFeedback welcome, and thank you for time!\n",

PRIV uses res.download() to send file.\n3. PUB gets response, clones response headers, executes res.send(res.body).\n4. User downloads a 0-byte file.

    "body": "Recently I have found my self in two different situations where I needed to abort a response that I already started streaming. Doing this in a reliable way across different situations proved to be quite hard. We finally came up with a solution to the problem.\n\n``` js\nfunction abortStreamingResponse(res) {\n    /* If you encounter an error after initializing a streaming response,\n     * it is not straight forward to abort it and cause the response to\n     * be interpreted as an error in the browser.\n     *\n     * This was the only reliable way we found to interrupt the streaming\n     * response in all cases.\n     *\n     * There's two cases that you have to consider when doing this:\n     *\n     * 1: You encounter an error before the headers are sent.\n     * 2: You encounter an error after the headers are sent.\n     *\n     * Express will claim that the headers are sent (res.headersSent), even\n     * before they are actually written to the socket. By writing something\n     * that looks like a valid response header in addition to what Express\n     * has already written, or has qued to be written, you will cause the\n     * response to inevitable cause an invalid chunked encoding error.\n     */\n    res.connection.write(\n        'HTTP/1.1 500 Let\\'s ruin that response!\\r\\n' +\n        'Content-Type: text/plain\\r\\n' +\n        'Transfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n    );\n    res.end();\n}\n```\n\nWe had multiple places across our application where we could encounter errors in the source streams that we pipe to res, so we actually went even further. We added an error handler, that incorporated this method.\n\n``` js\nreturn function (err, req, res, next) {\n    var responseObj = { ... };\n    // If res.headersSent is true, Express has either written\n    // the response headers to the socket, or qued them to be\n    // written. Which means that we will get an exception if\n    // we try to set the status code of the response etc. When\n    // we need to handle an error after that moment we need to\n    // corrupt the response already given to the client.\n    if (res.headersSent) {\n        return abortStreamingResponse(res);\n    }\n    return res.status(statusCode).send(responseObj);\n}\n```\n\nThis allows us to pass errors to the next callback, even after we started writing the response. The result in the browser will be an error `ERR_INVALID_CHUNKED_ENCODING` in Chrome, and similar errors in other browsers. \n\nWhat have you done when you have been in similar situations?\n\nIt seems like a problem that you would run into constantly when developing applications where you are streaming stuff out to clients over HTTP. But I have not been able to find any mentions about it when searching around. It seems like something you'd want to have a baked in solution to in Express - I'm not saying that it should be my solution - but just some solution.\n",

However, it's not very awesome that we have a single, overarching, configuration for the view engine that the root and all modules have to use - even if modules want to use something different.\n\nYes there is an option to manually call the template engines, but that's just a pain when we're already half way there.

This...\n\n```\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\n// generate error on every request\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  next(new Error('Always, I want to be with you'));\n});\n\n// route /test with own error handler\nvar testRouter = express.Router();\ntestRouter.use(function(err, req, res, next) {\n  res.send('testRouter error handler: ' + err.message); // <-- never called, even for requests to /test\n});\napp.use('/test', testRouter);\n\n// default error handler\napp.use(function(err, req, res, next) {\n  res.send('default error handler: ' + err.message);\n});\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n\n...will always return `default error handler: Always, I want to be with you`, regardless of the requested resource. If `next(err)` would really \"skip all remaining handlers in the chain except for those that are set up to handle errors\",  the result for requests to `/test` should be `testRouter error handler: Always, I want to be with you`.\n\nI stumbled upon this when trying to catch errors from a \"globally\" applied bodyParser in a router which handles API requests (because I need to have a different error output there).\n",

    "body": "Hi.\n\nI am a bit puzzled by this, as there are no reports, yet my various attempts came up with nothing.\n\nAnyway - trying to relocate the `views` folder doesn't work.\n\nThis code (in `server.js` file in the root of the project):\n\n```\nvar express = require('express');\nvar expressHbs = require('express-handlebars');\n\nvar app = express();\n\napp.set('views', __dirname + '/views1');\napp.engine('hbs', expressHbs({extname:'hbs', defaultLayout:'main.hbs'}));\napp.set('view engine', 'hbs');\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res){\n  res.render('index');\n});\n\napp.listen(8080);\n```\n\nwhere `views1` is (and it is in the root folder, the same with the `server.js` above):\n\n```\nviews1                         \n└───layouts     \n│        └───main.hbs\n└───index.hbs   \n```\n\nproduces this (abridged):\n\n```\nError: ENOENT, open '<path-to-root-folder>/views/layouts/main.hbs'\n```\n\n**Renaming the folder to `views` and removing `app.set('views', ...);` line makes this work properly.**\n\nI must be missing something, as this is too basic a functionality to not work.\n\nP.S. \n\nThere were additional attempts revolving around using something like this instead (to make sure that the path is resolved properly and whatnot):\n\n```\napp.set('views', path.resolve(__dirname, 'views1'));\n```\n\nto no avail.\n",

However, the new `res.sendFile` does not allow relative paths: `TypeError: path must be absolute or specify root to res.sendFile`.\n\nMy question is why not?\n\nIn #2360 @dougwilson claims that `process.cwd()` can change at runtime and that relative paths are bad for security and can break things. I am not clear why or how this issue can occur.\n\nPlease could someone provide a more detailed explanation for this.\n\nIf this really is an issue enough to warrant changing the API to prohibit it, may I suggest that the documentation for sendFile should be updated with the explanation? Otherwise, aren't people just going to do one of the following instead? Aren't these subject to the same issue?\n\n```\nres.sendFile(path.join(process.cwd(), file))\nres.sendFile(file, { root: process.cwd() })\n```\n\nThanks.\n",

My fonts folder in inside my public folder.\nBut I had to back out and use `cache-control`. In my case it was not an issue but this is a pita. Disabling headers needs to be done in an option object and can't be done in the _setHeaders_ function. Since you can't have _use express.static_ in nested folders (the last _app.use(express.static..._ will win) you have to change your site structure. **Pita!**\n\nThe _right_ way to go about this could be to not touch the `response` object after the _setHeaders_ function.\n\nThis probably need a fix in [serve-static](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static) first and then incorporated into express.\n",

    "body": "Hi! I wanted to ask about an exception that gets thrown if the OPTIONS request is handled anywhere in the stack. Here is sample code to reproduce copied from `tets/app.options.js` with an additional call to `next()` at the end:\n\n``` javascript\nvar app = express();\n\napp.options('/users', function(req, res, next){\n  res.set('Allow', 'GET');\n  res.send('GET');\n  next(); // added line\n});\n\napp.get('/users', function(req, res){});\napp.put('/users', function(req, res){});\n\nrequest(app)\n.options('/users')\n.expect('GET')\n.expect('Allow', 'GET', done);\n```\n\nIt looks like the default OPTIONS handler tries to send headers down after we already did so in our own handler. My use case for this is having logging middleware that gets hit at the very end after the response body is already sent, which requires me to call `next()` after `res.end()`.\n\nIdeally, if a handler for the OPTIONS request is already defined, it'd be nice to not call the default handler. I was going to writing a patch for this but ran into a few stumbling blocks I'd like to ask about. The possibilities so far:\n#### Option 1: If  OPTIONS middleware is defined, don't `sendOptionsResponse()`\n\nThis breaks `app.all()` which adds an OPTIONS handler by default; this test specifically: https://github.com/strongloop/express/blob/4.12.4/test/app.options.js#L33\n\nI imagine that changing `app.all` not to add an OPTIONS handler would be a significant breaking change, so this didn't seem like the best idea.\n#### Option 2: Checking that headers were already sent\n\nIf `res.headersSent` is set, we can reasonably assume that something else is already handling the OPTIONS call, since the default handler's job is to set Cross-Site related headers. But this option breaks another test: https://github.com/strongloop/express/blob/4.12.4/test/app.options.js#L75\n\nNow, this test confuses me a bit. It assumes that the default handler will still run despite us having explicit OPTIONS middleware _and_ that further middleware should be able to write the body. What's the use case for this? The [original issue](https://github.com/strongloop/express/issues/2494) seems unrelated.\n\nThanks!\n",

    "body": "As initially conjectured in https://github.com/strongloop/express/issues/2129#issuecomment-107499990, Express's default etag behavior is **very broken**.\n\nAs stated by [section 2.1 of RFC 7232](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.1):\n\n>  A \"strong validator\" is representation metadata that changes value\n> whenever a change occurs to the representation data that would be\n> observable in the payload body of a 200 (OK) response to GET.\n> \n> [...]\n> \n> A collision-resistant hash function applied to\n> the representation data is also sufficient if the data is available\n> prior to the response header fields being sent and the digest does\n> not need to be recalculated every time a validation request is\n> received.\n> \n> [...]\n> \n> In contrast, a \"weak validator\" is representation metadata that might\n> not change for every change to the representation data.  This\n> weakness might be due to limitations in how the value is calculated,\n> such as clock resolution, an inability to ensure uniqueness for all\n> possible representations of the resource, or a desire of the resource\n> owner to group representations by some self-determined set of\n> equivalency rather than unique sequences of data.  An origin server\n> SHOULD change a weak entity-tag whenever it considers prior\n> representations to be unacceptable as a substitute for the current\n> representation.  In other words, a weak entity-tag ought to change\n> whenever the origin server wants caches to invalidate old responses.\n> \n> For example, the representation of a weather report that changes in\n> content every second, based on dynamic measurements, might be grouped\n> into sets of equivalent representations (from the origin server's\n> perspective) with the same weak validator in order to allow cached\n> representations to be valid for a reasonable period of time (perhaps\n> adjusted dynamically based on server load or weather quality).\n> Likewise, a representation's modification time, if defined with only\n> one-second resolution, might be a weak validator if it is possible\n> for the representation to be modified twice during a single second\n> and retrieved between those modifications.\n> \n> Likewise, a validator is weak if it is shared by two or more\n> representations of a given resource at the same time, unless those\n> representations have identical representation data.  For example, if\n> the origin server sends the same validator for a representation with\n> a gzip content coding applied as it does for a representation with no\n> content coding, then that validator is weak.\n\nTL;DR: A \"weak etag\" is an etag that is based on **metadata**. The \"weak\" in \"weak etag\" has **nothing to do with collision-resistance weakness**: _all_ etags are interpreted to be semantically collision-resistant. Yet the behavior of Express when `etag` is set to `weak` (the default) is to use a hash-like function _not_ resistant to collisions, prefixed with 'W/' (the signifier that denotes that the response would be semantically equivalent, if not byte equivalent, to other responses with that etag). \n\nOn top of being semantically wrong, this could be exploited by an attacker to set a value that would permute a page's etag to remain the same, denying requests for it from receiving the new version of the page whenever its content would be changed.\n",

Any array members with an index of greater than 20 will instead be converted to an object\n\nThis value (`20`) can be changed so that's not a problem. However, I believe this should be documented in express.\n",
