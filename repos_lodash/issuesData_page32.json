    "body": "When using `flow`, I often find myself having to add another step to use a certain property of an object, and end up with something like this (using `lodash/fp`)\n\n``` js\nconst takePlentyOfApples = _.flow(\n  _.get('foo.items'),\n  _.filter(_.overSome([\n    {type: 'apple'},\n    _.flow(\n     _.property('count'),\n     _.gt(_, 10)\n    )\n  ]))\n);\n```\n\nWhat I'd like to propose, is to allow `flow` to use path shorthand notations, in order to be able to write the previous example like the following\n\n``` js\nconst takePlentyOfApples = _.flow(\n   'foo.items',\n  _.filter(_.overSome([\n    {type: 'apple'},\n    _.flow('count', _.gt(_, 10)))\n  ]))\n);\n```\n\nIt would be nice if it supported both direct property access, nested property and array path access\n\n``` js\n_.flow(\n  'property',\n  'nested.property',\n  ['path', 0, 'access']\n)\n```\n\nI became kind of envious when I saw this ability in Elm to create property functions really simply\n\n```\n> .name bill\n\"Gates\"\n\n> List.map .name [bill,bill,bill]\n[\"Gates\",\"Gates\",\"Gates\"]\n\n// .name === _.property('name') in JS\n```\n",

    "body": "I have just noticed the existence of `conforms` and found it kind of odd, or at least impractical that you can only have predicate functions associated to each key, and not a direct value like `matches` does.\n\nThat means that if I have multiple properties to check, some with a predicate, and some where the values are fixed, I'd need to use both `matches` and `conforms`, and have two `source` objects, one for each of them.\n\n``` js\nconst object = {\n  a: 10,\n  b: 100\n}; // imagine a bigger object in practice\n\nconst doesMatch = _.matches({a: 10})(object) && _.conforms({\n  b: (b) => b > 100\n})(object);\n```\n\nWouldn't it be more useful if one of those methods accepted both predicates and values? (probably `conforms`, as it wont be breaking change for this one). I'm not sure I actually see the point of having both methods in the long run, except if people actually use `matches` to check whether objects have the same function in two objects.\n\nBy the way, another thing that I noticed while writing this: `conforms` doesn't accept nested paths, which looks very impractical to me.\n",

However, I've come across an issue where the currying sequence of `getOr` doesn't seem to be updated after reordering it's arguments via `rearg`.\n\n``` js\nconst map = {\n  test: 'hello'\n};\n\nrearg([0, 2, 1], getOr)(null, map, 'test') //$\n// $> 'hello'\n\nrearg([0, 2, 1], getOr)(null)(map)('test') //$\n// $> null\n```\n\nI'd expect the second invocation to be no different than the first, and therefore return `hello`.\n\nPlease let me know if I'm doing something wrong and there's an easy workaround.\n\nCheers\n\nJames\n",

    "body": "Thank you everyone for their hard work on this project and lodash/fp.  Anything that encourages composition is a huge win for the JS ecosystem.\n\nI'm proposing that Lodash supports dispatch to methods on custom types.  This is the number one feature I miss when using lodash/fp in place of Ramda.\n\nAn example: say I am using a Bluebird promise that has the methods `filter`, `reduce` and `map`.  With Ramda I can use `R.filter`, `R.reduce` and `R.map`to dispatch to these methods on the Promise.\n\n``` js\nvar R = require('ramda')\nvar Promise = require('bluebird')\n\nvar numbers = Promise.all([1,2,3,4])\n\nvar f = R.pipe(\n  R.map(R.multiply(2))\n  ,R.filter( R.gt( R.__, 4))\n  ,R.sum // dispatches to Promise::reduce\n)\nawait f(numbers) //=> 14\n\nf([1,2,3,4]) //=> 14\n```\n\nThis dispatch allows you to write one function that can traverse multiple data types.  You could just as easily pass in a fantasy land compatible stream like most.js or flyd.  Or a Future, Task, Maybe, Either etc.  And most importantly it would support any type that the user may want to develop within their own code base.\n\nNote that above we don't need to concern ourselves with chaining `.then` calls.  We have abstracted away the specifics of the underlying type.  And now the function `f` (from above) would work equally well on an array, or a hundred other types.\n\nLodash is such an important part of the JS ecosystem, I would see supporting this functionality as both extremely useful and also a vote of confidence in composition.\n",

I can't make sense of this.\n\nFWIW, I'm running `node v4.0.0` on Crunchbang Linux, which is basically Debian Wheezy.\n\nThanks!\n",

I think the two ways to fix this would placing another section above e.g.\n\n> Methods that accept an array of arguments as their first parameter\n\nOr rewording it e.g.\n\n> Methods that accept an array of arguments in lieu of the rest parameter\n\nI also couldn't decide whether moving it down by the New Methods section would make sense because it's not actually an exception to the argument order, just a result of fixing arity.\n\nIf you think this is too minute, feel free to close.\n",

Of course, the expected value is not what was intended, but that's not the issue here.\n\n```\nvar x1 = _.mergeWith({}, def, row, _.noop);\nconsole.log(\"x1 --> \", x1);\nconsole.log(\"x1 == ex --> \", _.isEqual(x1, ex)); // false as expected\nconsole.log(\"def == orig_def --> \", _.isEqual(def, orig_def)); // true as expected\nconsole.log(\"obj == orig_obj --> \", _.isEqual(obj, orig_obj)); // true as expected\nconsole.log(\"obj --> \", obj);\n/*\nobj is, as expected:\n  {\n    o1: null,\n    o2: null\n  }\n*/\n```\n\nHowever, if we merge with customizer, then the sources are modified.\n\n```\nvar x2 = _.mergeWith({}, def, row, customizer);\nconsole.log(\"x2 --> \", x2);\nconsole.log(\"x2 == ex --> \", _.isEqual(x2, ex)); // true as expected\nconsole.log(\"def == orig_def --> \", _.isEqual(def, orig_def)); // FALSE!\nconsole.log(\"obj == orig_obj --> \", _.isEqual(obj, orig_obj)); // FALSE!\nconsole.log(\"obj --> \", obj);\n/*\nobj is MODIFIED:\n  {\n    o1: \"a\",\n    o2: null\n  }\n*/\n```\n\nI don't know if this is the intended behavior, I solved the issue passing to original `t10` key a cloned object, but it looks like an inconsistence in `mergeWith` behavior, compared with `merge` (which does not modify the sources).\n\nThank you\n",

    "body": "Recently I've encountered an issue where [adding fractional numbers results in rounding errors](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/is-floating-point-math-broken). This can be solved by using a rounding implementation (lodash' _.round seems to be a proper implementation, but there's some controversy around rounding in javascript and people tend to resort to the manual [Firefox rounding implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round#Decimal_rounding)).\n\nCase in point:\n\n``` javascript\nvar a = 14.38;\nvar b = 148.95;\nvar c = a + b;\n\nconsole.log(c); // 163.32999999999998\nconsole.log(_.round(c, 2)); // 163.33\n\n// similar error with 0.1 + 0.2 and so on\n```\n\nNormally we can compensate for these rounding errors by rounding after the addition. _.sum doesn't support this: given enough numbers to summate the result _.sum gives forces us to reduce the decimals we must round to, in order to eliminate the rounding error.\n\nI've prepare a jsFiddle with an example. https://jsfiddle.net/plantface/f0h2rj5a/\n",

    "body": "All the `_.union` family of functions are chainable, but don't actually work when used in a chain. The problem is that  `union()` takes multiple array arguments instead of a collection of arrays, but the whole chained value is passed as the first argument without being split. So this happens:\n\n``` js\n// Use u instead of _ in the repl\nu([[1,2,3,5],[1,2,4,8]]).union().value();\n// [ [ 1, 2, 3, 5 ], [ 1, 2, 4, 8 ] ]\nu([[1,2,3,5],[1,2,4,8]]).unionBy(u.identity).value();\n// [ [ 1, 2, 3, 5 ], [ 1, 2, 4, 8 ] ]\nu([[1,2,3,5],[1,2,4,8]]).unionBy('a').value();\n// [ [ 1, 2, 3, 5 ] ]  both == 'undefined'\n```\n\nThis was referenced in https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/1105 and the solution was to just use `_.spread`, which only really works for plain `_.union` but more importantly defeats the point of `_.union` being chainable at all. \n\nRight now, the behavior of `union()` in a chain is the same as `uniq()`:\n\n``` js\nu([1,2,2,3,23]).union().value();\n// [ 1, 2, 3, 23 ]\n```\n\nIt's doubtful that anyone is using it this way intentionally. \n\nI would either not make `_.union` and its buddies chainable at all, or automatically `spread()` when union is invoked on a chain.\n\nLet me know what you think, I'll happily make a PR.\n",

    "body": "Hi! First of all, thanks for this amazing project. Now to the request, it would be really nice if we could return a default value if the `find` method doesn't find anything.\n\nSimple use case:\n\nLet's say we have to return the age of the first person with name 'Mateo'. Normally we would need to do it like this:\n\n``` javascript\nlet people = _([\n  { name: 'Adam', age: 27 },\n  { name: 'Jane', age: 24 },\n  { name: 'David', age: 26 },\n  { name: 'Jeffrey', age: 32 },\n  { name: 'Evan', age: 26 },\n]);\n\nlet person = people.find({ name: 'Mateo' });\n\nif (person) {\n  return person.age;\n}\n\nreturn 0;\n```\n\nBut wouldn't it be nicer if could just simply do this:\n\n``` javascript\nreturn people\n         .find({ name: 'Mateo' }, 0, { name: ' ', age: 0 })\n         .age;\n```\n\nThis gets even more relevant when you start to use `Null Objects` with it's own methods. It saves the check to see if something was found.\n\nIf approved, I can write the implementation and submit a PR.\n",

In order to make that work, I have a script which rewrites the file extensions to differentiate between the file types (`.js` for es5 and `es6` for es6). The easy short term solution is to keep using 4.12. Longer term I can rewrite my script to rewrite the import lines as well, but thought I'd first check in with you to make sure that change was intentional and would be sticking around in future versions. Seemed kind of arbitrary...\n\nThanks in advance for the info\n",

    "body": "This is my first post on this repo so hello all and great job. I was looking for a convenient way to use _.ary in a way that would ignore arguments from left rather than right. I think it's best to jump straight to an example to see what I mean. I'm using node fs functions that execute callbacks with two arguments, i.e.:\n\n`fs.readFile('/etc/passwd', (err, data) => {\n  // callback body\n});`\n\nNow, let's suppose I have a callback function ready, but it doesn't expect the _err_ argument. If I could use, for example, _.aryRight, I'd go:\n\n`fs.readFile('/etc/passwd', _.aryRight(customCallback, 1));`\n\nOr, even better, if _.ary accepted negative number to work from right, (e.g. like fromIndex in _.indexOf/_.includes or n in _.nth):\n\n`fs.readFile('/etc/passwd', _.ary(customCallback, -1));`\n\nI know I could use _.filp or _.rearg for that, but still it's a bit hacky and the above I think would look cleaner.\n",
