    "body": "Synopsis: \r\n\r\nAllow external collections (e.g. mobx, immutablejs, mori, etc) to declare lodash compatibility by implementing lodash-specific symbols.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nWhenever someone builds a new collection library, they need to re-implement data manipulation methods. These range from bare minimum (e.g. mobx) to okay (immutablejs) - however, none of them could hope to match the extensive lodash collection.\r\n\r\nIt seems like ES6 is moving towards a direction where protocols (interfaces) will be more common, with ES6 iterables being one of the more interesting examples.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there was a lodash-symbols package which contains symbols of various lodash protocols. A collection library could implement some of these symbols, and lodash could check whether passed objects contain them and attempt to use them.\r\n\r\nFor example, reduce could be implemented in terms of \"lodashIterable\"\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction reduce(collection, reducer, initialValue) {\r\n  if (typeof collection[lodashIterableSymbol] === 'function') {\r\n    let iterator = collection[lodashIterableSymbol](), reduced = initialValue\r\n    while (iterator.next()) { reduced = reducer(reduced, iterator.value) }\r\n    return reduced\r\n  } else {\r\n    // default impl.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be taken a step further to support existing libraries without monkey patching by providing definition maps. lodash could look up the \"getIterator\" method from a (weak)map which can be amended by other libraries `definitionMap.get(lodashIterableSymbol).get(obj.constructor)`. Then we would be able to add lodash support to things such as HTML collection elements like `HTMLCollection`, or any other library that doesn't want to implement lodash support itself. ",

    "body": "Personally, I think it's a good idea - so 👍 for that. \r\n\r\nI see lodash/lodash gets a lot of asking why a property called \"length\" breaks _.map, so that has to be part of it. \r\n\r\nPart of me wants to know if there is a deeper philosophical reason. My personal crusade is having people be explicit when decomposing objects - be it via an array literal, `object.keys()`,`object.entries()`, or the future` _.mapObject`. Either way you do it, Object and Array are different, and a developer needs to be somewhat thoughtful of that. \r\n\r\nAlso wondering how much changes on the roadmap should be planned for - obviously would like to minimize the amount of re-factor needed to upgrade out apps. \r\n\r\nAlso apologies if the issue tracker is not the right place for this - I did an exhaustive search of the repo and couldn't find anything that answered my question.

    "body": "Hey There!\r\n\r\n  Saw some discussions about supporting iterables and I think your response there makes a lot of sense.  They are easy enough to coerce to standard arrays anyway.\r\n\r\n  However, I can see the benefit in supporting, in some fashion, getting (and setting) of map values with the _.get and _.set  and friends. \r\n\r\n  Obviously we can only accept string keys when using the string-style paths, but could even support object and other keys if an array-style path is created instead.\r\n\r\n  While maps don't have many of the issues that objects have, it can still be tremendously helpful when working with nested object values.  \r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst obj = {\r\n  map: new Map([['foo', 'bar'], ['baz', 'qux']]),\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst foo = _.get(obj, 'map.foo')\r\n_.set(obj, 'map.lux', 'dax')\r\n// or\r\n_.set(obj, [ 'map', { s: 'lux' } ], 'dax')\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich could also go further \r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst obj = {\r\n  map: new Map([['foo', 'bar'], ['baz', 'qux']]),\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst foo = _.get(obj, 'map.foo')\r\n_.set(obj, 'map.lux',{ val: 'dax' })\r\n\r\nconst luxVal = _.get(obj, 'map.foo.lux.val')\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it would make sense to handle sets as well for setting them similar to how an array is set/get.\r\n\r\nLOVE lodash - Thanks to all that put time into the development!",

However if it were possible to pass lodash a transformation, this would let people get at lodash's binary search capability.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose a large sorted array of objects of the shape `{ value: Number }`. Unless I'm mistaken, there's no way to find a specific element except linearly. This need would be served by `_.sortedFind(arr, item => item.value)`.\r\n\r\nThis might need some workshopping, but basically if it were easier to access the binary search then a common pain point for me would be met.",

It doesn't happen when picking \"`non-object`\" values, for example (having the same `initialObject`):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar pickedObject = _.pick(initialObject, ['someOtherValue']);\r\n\r\npickedObject.someOtherValue = 0;\r\nconsole.log(pickedObject.someOtherValue);  // 0\r\nconsole.log(initialObject.someOtherValue);  // 42\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've solved the bug that has bugged me for days (pun intended) by wrapping the `_.pick()` call with the `_.cloneDeep()` to sever the ties between the `objects`.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't have submitted a new issue had the [documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#pick) not stated that it `Returns the new object.` (the same problem applies when using `_.omit()`) \r\n\r\n",

Not being able to optionally enforce deterministic behaviour in a functional setting is... odd. I would like to suggest the discussion over possible enhancements and alternatives to implement such feature, amongst which:\r\n\r\n* Change all internal function call of `Math.random()` to a lodash random number generator;\r\n* Make this random number generator a... generator function;\r\n* Support passing an extra parameter in functions like `sample` to set the seed;\r\n* Support an optional callback in functions like `sample` that provides a generator;\r\n* Get an objective measurement on the performance impact of such changes, and aim for a zero-cost abstraction so we don't end up with angry people.",

I think it's more  clear for many params in a config file since there could be some structures to use such as Map to specify params and Array for method list e.t.c.\r\nSo could there be such a feature in lodash-cli to support this? :)",

    "body": "Hey,\r\n\r\nI have a simple use case where I use `cond` to basically emulate a switch. It gets called with the first argument being the *pivot* (a type defined as a `string`). I would then like to call different functions depending on the value of the *pivot*. All those functions are not interested by the *pivot*, but the rest of the arguments. I know I could use a simple object indexed by types, but I want a generic pattern that work when the *pivot* is a complex type (`object`, `function`, ...).\r\n\r\nI've experimented several ways of doing so with Lodash and couldn't find a *simple* way. Perhaps I missed it, and if so sorry for the issue.\r\n\r\nThe only short way is to use splats like so:\r\n```js\r\nconst handleActions = cond([\r\n  [matches('create'), (type, ...args) => handleCreate(...args)]\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy proposal would be to add a new `_.shift` function with the following signature: `_.shift(func, [increment=1])`\r\n\r\nIt would work as the `shift` operator but for args and would shift a given number of arguments defined by an `increment`. Depending of the sign of `increment`, those arguments would be shifted left or right. By default (and because it's the most common use case), a positive value would shift arguments to the left, a negative to the right.\r\n\r\nExample use case:\r\n```js\r\nconst add(a, b) => a + b\r\nconst sub(a, b) => a - b\r\n\r\nconst apply = cond([\r\n  [matches('add'), shift(add)],\r\n  [matches('sub'), shift(sub)]\r\n])\r\n\r\napply('add', 1, 2)\r\n// => 3\r\n```",
