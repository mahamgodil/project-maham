    "body": "Hi! Ran into a confusing issue with `orderBy` when some but not all of the values for a given field can be `false`. I'll give an example of the issue first and then describe our use case below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example repro\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n\r\n// sorting by fields that can be a value or `null` works as expected,\r\n// and sorts the array by `b` asc and then `a` desc\r\n\r\nconst xs = [\r\n    {a: 4, b: null},\r\n    {a: 5, b: null},\r\n    {a: 7, b: \"something\"},\r\n    {a: 1, b: \"something else\"}\r\n]\r\n\r\n_.orderBy(xs, ['b', 'a'], ['asc', 'desc'])\r\n\r\n// =>\r\n[\r\n  {a: 7, b: \"something\"},\r\n  {a: 1, b: \"something else\"}\r\n  {a: 5, b: null},\r\n  {a: 4, b: null},\r\n]\r\n\r\n// however, if a value can either be a string or `false`,\r\n// then sorting by that field _doesn't happen at all_:\r\n\r\nconst ys = [\r\n    {a: 4, b: false},\r\n    {a: 5, b: false},\r\n    {a: 7, b: \"something\"},\r\n    {a: 1, b: \"something else\"}\r\n]\r\n\r\n_.orderBy(ys, ['b', 'a'], ['asc', 'desc'])\r\n\r\n// =>\r\n[\r\n  {a: 7, b: \"something\"},\r\n  {a: 5, b: false},\r\n  {a: 4, b: false},\r\n  {a: 1, b: \"something else\"}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're sorting an array of objects of different (but related) types using a set of comparator functions. We're also maintaining a sorted list of these objects so we can do membership tests and inserts using binary search to keep things O(log n), as the arrays can end up being very large.\r\n\r\nThe comparators we're using don't make sense for all the types of object that are in the array. So what we've been doing is have the comparator functions return the relevant field if it exists, or `false` if the comparator is not relevant to the object. However, we noticed that we were sometimes getting duplicates in our array, presumably because the binary search on insert was not finding the correct index in the array. Having dug into it, this behaviour of `lodash`s `orderBy` does seem to be the reason why.\r\n\r\nWe've changed our implementation to return `null` instead of `false` in these cases, which has fixed things for us in the meantime. But posting an issue in case this is something which can/should be fixed in lodash itself, so it doesn't confuse others like it did us.\r\n\r\nObviously it's questionable whether booleans or strings should come first when ordering an array of booleans and strings, but even if the choice of \"booleans first\" or \"strings first\" is mostly arbitrary, it would prevent weird behaviour happening in cases like ours if they were sorted in this way consistently.\r\n\r\nHappy to have a crack at fixing this if there's appetite for a PR.",

    "body": "Hey @jdalton great to see activity here.\r\n\r\nThe past week I had started fixing up master and diving into the v4 codebase to understand the partial migration that had been started in master. I [figured out which tests are broken on master](https://gist.github.com/jonchurch/319c92547d7710ea1e6212db43b6412d) (not entirely exhaustive, excludes suites that fail bc a lodash method they tested was deleted) and in most cases tracked down the commit that likely did it.\r\n\r\nI almost posted my WIP [Short Term Maintenance plan](https://gist.github.com/jonchurch/637aa1e601141cc27361b353852b164b) on Saturday, glad I held off! You've already knocked out items on that list.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion for V5\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest a direction for V5 and V6 if I may be so bold. My _personal goals_ from my above plan and Step 0 were:\r\n\r\n> ## Goals\r\n> \r\n> 1. Get master branch to a state where it can be cloned and successfully run all tests\r\n> 2. Ensure Github Actions workflows run tests on; PR opened, PR updated, push to master branch\r\n> 3. Clear the way for contributions to Lodash v5\r\n> 4. Document breaking changes that have already been merged to master, evaluate if they should be rolled back\r\n> 5. Explore if the v4 release can be released without breaking changes from a fixed up master branch\r\n> 6. Modernize master branch to 2023 package maintenance standards (debateable what that means 😂)\r\n> \r\n> ## Non-Goals\r\n> \r\n> 1. Release v5\r\n> 2. Break v4\r\n> 3. Open PRs that are impossible to review rigorously due to volume of changes\r\n> \r\n> ## Step 0: Decide on Master Branch Direction\r\n> \r\n> Due to breaking changes already in master, decide whether it will serve as the base for a new major release or a fix-up of v4. This will inform all subsequent steps.\r\n> \r\n> Examples of breaking commits are (in order of earliest to latest):\r\n> \r\n> - [3b4cbc70e7](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/3b4cbc70e7)\r\n> - [5baad4df1015](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/5baad4df1015)\r\n> - [bb7c959479](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/bb7c959479)\r\n> - [3e2b0bb763](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/3e2b0bb763)\r\n> - [aa1d7d870d](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/aa1d7d870d)\r\n\r\n### I'd like to suggest that the v5 release break only the legacy AMD/UMD module support, and avoid lodash method functionality breakage.\r\n\r\nThe more I worked on my fork at [jonchurch/lodash (js-test branch)](https://github.com/jonchurch/lodash/tree/js-tests) the more I thought about what could bring value to a new release. \r\n\r\n**The big question is, can we publish a v5 that does not introduce breaking changes to the method functionality?**\r\n\r\nI want to see lodash v5:\r\n\r\n* Use modern module systems (CJS and ESM dual publish)\r\n* Drop support for ES5\r\n* Update the DX for contribution to modern standards \r\n  * linting\r\n  * github action workflows on all commits to master and PRs\r\n* Use modern [package.json exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points)\r\n* Export lodash.js as a barrel file instead of it being all in one to avoid publishing copies of all the methods as duplicated single files (which is what v4 currently does in the main package)\r\n* Avoid breaking lodash v4 method functionality\r\n\r\nThese breaking changes are largely DX, package, and long term maintenance oriented. They also represent what I think is a logical way to break up development into something easier to follow and audit by the community. One new release with both packaging, test structure, support level, and functionality changes would be a pretty massive delta that could  get very confusing to follow very quickly.\r\n\r\nThe TS rewrite could also happen in this v5 release, and in fact might make the transition to a functionally breaking v6 much smoother and easier to migrate to.\r\n\r\nHaving a transitional v5 release like this could also make any fixes needed to v4 compatible code much easier. We can tell people to upgrade to v5 to receive any critical fixes, and EOL v4. Imagine having to make changes to v4 with the old setup, after investing in the new setup. I think having a modern v5 with v4 API support will make it much more pleasurable to commit and release fixes to v4 compatible APIs (but release the fix in v5 only).\r\n\r\nThose commits I listed are a non-exhaustive list of breaking changes, but they are pretty close I believe. It might make sense to start master over with a fresh migration of v4, instead of attempting to revert the non-backwards compatible changes merged into master in the past 4 years.\r\n\r\n## My Ask\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Do these suggestions resonate with you?\r\n\r\nIf offered help to achieve this functionally backwards compatible v5 approach, would you accept it?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time. (P.S. I'm fine with v5 using Bun for the dev runtime, runtime doesn't matter to me here) ",

    "body": "Hello @jdalton :wave: \r\n\r\nI would like to suggest to improve the communication with the lodash community with some more or less simple changes\r\n\r\n1. open the \"Discussions\" feature on the repository\r\n2. Pinning (even closed) issues like https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/5716\r\n3. Writing a statement why the repo radically closed all issues and PRs\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI just assume and find out that lodash is now working on a full rewrite on v5 driven by Bun support\r\nI support that! lodash is used by MANY packages and nearly every project feels like having a 50% that any sub-dependency contains lodash somehow.\r\nWith that responsibility the lodash maintainers should try to not mess with their community.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm biased about such radical changes due to I'm the maintainer of a repo that we took over due to a radical situation... but I just want a healthy community 🤗",

Using the sandbox:\r\n- Type \"ada\" into the input\r\n- We'll get three results for each character typed, and 2 network requests (one for the leading invocation, and another for the trailing invocation)\r\n- The first two results will correctly correspond to the leading invocation (one fresh, and the second stale).\r\n- The final result will incorrectly correspond to the leading invocation as well, even though the network tab shows that a trailing request was invoked with fresh data in the response.\r\n- We can ensure that the stale data is not due to NextJS nor React caching of the request, as logging of the raw response shows that the fresh data made it to the client, but stale data was returned by the debounced function.\r\n- Similar behavior occurs when leading is false but trailing is still true--a request is made and data is returned, but the debounced function returns undefined. [The documentation](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/lodash/common/function.d.ts#L374) specifies that this means the function was never invoked, even though it was.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n```\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 6.1 Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) 11 (bullseye)\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 AMD EPYC\r\n    Memory: 5.07 GB / 8.01 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.1.4 - /bin/bash\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.17.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.15.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n    pnpm: 7.1.0 - /usr/local/bin/pnpm\r\n    Watchman: 20220528.183901.0 - /usr/local/bin/watchman\r\n npmPackages:\r\n    @faker-js/faker: 7.6.0 => 7.6.0 \r\n    @types/lodash.debounce: 4.0.7 => 4.0.7 \r\n    @types/node: 20.5.9 => 20.5.9 \r\n    @types/react: 18.0.29 => 18.0.29 \r\n    @types/react-dom: 18.0.11 => 18.0.11 \r\n    classnames: 2.3.2 => 2.3.2 \r\n    lodash.debounce: 4.0.8 => 4.0.8 \r\n    next: 13.4.19 => 13.4.19 \r\n    react: 18.2.0 => 18.2.0 \r\n    react-dom: 18.2.0 => 18.2.0 \r\n    typescript: 5.2.2 => 5.2.2\r\n  Virtualization:\r\n    Docker: 24.0.5 - /usr/bin/docker\r\n```",

The `_.debounce()` function now avoids this issue by running the trailing debounce immediately if the tab is closed prior to the trailing timeout.\r\n\r\nThe implementation detects whether lodash is running in a headless environment (e.g. Node.js). If so, the new functionality is ignored since it's not relevant outside of a web browser.\r\n\r\nResolves #5689 @jdalton",

Their aim is:\n\n> We created Scorecard to help open source maintainers improve their security best practices and to help open source consumers judge whether their dependencies are safe.\n\n> Scorecard is an automated tool that assesses a number of important heuristics (\"checks\") associated with software security and assigns each check a score of 0-10. You can use these scores to understand specific areas to improve in order to strengthen the security posture of your project. You can also assess the risks that dependencies introduce, and make informed decisions about accepting these risks, evaluating alternative solutions, or working with the maintainers to make improvements.\n\n**Unfortunately, this project only received a value of 3.4/10**\n\nPlease follow these steps to add the Action to the codescanning suite to ensure this project continues to stays

    "body": "At SetCache, it uses only `set` and `has` methods of the MapCache class. These methods are also offered by JavaScript's built-in Map and Set object. Furthermore, SetCache maps all values to a constant (`HASH_UNDEFINED`), which essentially ignores the key-value mapping nature of a Map, and aligns more closely with the behaviour of a Set.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose that we consider replacing MapCache with Map (or even Set) in the SetCache class. This could simplify the code and potentially reduce overhead. \r\n",

    "body": "I need to take the intersection of multiple array objects, and the length of the array is uncertain. Each object needs to have the same two Keys of `name` and `type` to take the intersection. So I used lodash's intersectionWith method.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst data = [\r\n  [\r\n    { name: 'a', type: 'string' },\r\n    { name: 'b', type: 'number' },\r\n    { name: 'c', type: 'date' },\r\n  ],\r\n  [\r\n    { name: 'a', type: 'string' },\r\n    { name: 'f', type: 'number' },\r\n    { name: 'c', type: 'date' },\r\n  ],\r\n  [\r\n    { name: 'a', type: 'string' },\r\n    { name: 's', type: 'number' },\r\n    { name: 'c', type: 'date' },\r\n  ],\r\n  [\r\n    { name: 'a', type: 'string' },\r\n    { name: 's', type: 'number' },\r\n    { name: 'c', type: 'date' },\r\n  ],\r\n];\r\n\r\n\r\nconst res = intersectionWith(...data, (a, b) => {\r\n  console.log(a, b)\r\n  return a.name === b.name && a.type === b.type\r\n})\r\n\r\nconsole.log('res', res)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the running result is correct, but ts will report an error: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'never'.ts(2339)\r\n\r\nThen I checked the function signature of the intersectionWith method in the lodash source code：\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\ninterface LoDashStatic {\r\n        /**\r\n         * Creates an array of unique `array` values not included in the other\r\n         * provided arrays using [`SameValueZero`](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-samevaluezero)\r\n         * for equality comparisons.\r\n         *\r\n         * @category Array\r\n         * @param [values] The arrays to inspect.\r\n         * @param [comparator] The comparator invoked per element.\r\n         * @returns Returns the new array of filtered values.\r\n         * @example\r\n         *\r\n         * var objects = [{ 'x': 1, 'y': 2 }, { 'x': 2, 'y': 1 }];\r\n         * var others = [{ 'x': 1, 'y': 1 }, { 'x': 1, 'y': 2 }];\r\n\r\n         * _.intersectionWith(objects, others, _.isEqual);\r\n         * // => [{ 'x': 1, 'y': 2 }]\r\n         */\r\n        intersectionWith<T1, T2>(array: List<T1> | null | undefined, values: List<T2>, comparator: Comparator2<T1, T2>): T1[];\r\n        /**\r\n         * @see _.intersectionWith\r\n         */\r\n        intersectionWith<T1, T2, T3>(array: List<T1> | null | undefined, values1: List<T2>, values2: List<T3>, comparator: Comparator2<T1, T2 | T3>): T1[];\r\n        /**\r\n         * @see _.intersectionWith\r\n         */\r\n        intersectionWith<T1, T2, T3, T4>(array: List<T1> | null | undefined, values1: List<T2>, values2: List<T3>, ...values: Array<List<T4> | Comparator2<T1, T2 | T3 | T4>>): T1[];\r\n        /**\r\n         * @see _.intersectionWith\r\n         */\r\n        intersectionWith<T>(array?: List<T> | null, ...values: Array<List<T> | Comparator2<T, never>>): T[];\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this a type definition error?

    "body": "In plain old js `Math.max('1','2','11')` returns `11`\r\nIn lodash `_.max(['1','2','11'])` returns `'2'`\r\n\r\nOne could argue that type casting is not responsibility of lodash like in this [slightly condescending conversation](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/3477). **Which is correct.**\r\n\r\nHowever in the lodashian spirit of erroneous types one should expect lodash to return `undefined` whenever the arguments result in an ambiguous answer, like when doing `_.last` of `Infinity` etc. Either this, or not have this function under the \"Math\" section. Maybe rename it to `compareAndGetLastElementInArray` or something and not let it pose as a drop-in replacement for `Math.max`.\r\n\r\nIn addition if you mix the types:\r\n`_.max(['1',3,'2','11'])` it _correctly_ returns '11'\r\n\r\nBut if you throw in a 0 in there:\r\n`_.max(['1',0,'2','11'])` it retorts back to '2' again\r\n\r\nNegative number extort the same behaviour:\r\n`_.max(['1',-4,'2','11'])` => '2'\r\n\r\nAll in all thank you for a great and extremely delightful library, however I'll probably look at other libs for math operations in the future.",

    "body": "This is more of a question which may possibly be a bug.\r\n\r\nI was using the debouce function present on [master](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/2da024c3b4f9947a48517639de7560457cd4ec6c/debounce.js) specifically for the feature of `pending`.\r\n\r\nThe question is: Considering that a function `log` is debounced with `leading: true`, generating `logDebounced`. If `logDebounced` is called only once, during the `wait` period, should pending be `true` or `false`?\r\n\r\nCurrently it outputs `true`, but I believe that if there are no \"pending invokes\" it should output `false`. This would be helpful in cases where we are watching this variable to block navigation/show a loading state, since no more calls would be made we shouldn't need to wait for the `wait` time to expire.\r\n\r\nThe example in code is\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport debounce from \"./debounce.js\";\r\n\r\nconst WAIT = 1000;\r\n\r\nconst log = (text) => {\r\n  console.log(\"log\", text);\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst logDebounced = debounce(log, WAIT, { leading: true });\r\n\r\nlogDebounced(\"1\");\r\n\r\nconsole.log(logDebounced.pending()); // outputs true\r\n\r\nsetTimeout(() => {\r\n  console.log(logDebounced.pending());\r\n}, WAIT);\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

This has also caused heap memory out issue in the system and also slowed down the parent function.",
