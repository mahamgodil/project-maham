    "body": "Hi:\n\nYesterday the React Web App I had in the continuous integration system `npm install`-ed the latest version of lodash (v4.14.0 upgraded from v4.13.1) with the following library lineup. Then every tests started failing. \n\nAfter some investigation, it was found that both the Chrome (Version 52.0.2743.82 beta-m (64-bit) & Firefox browser (47.0.1) would **_not respond**_ when using the Web App. The process explorer shows that the **_browser had consumed 100% CPU with the increased memory footprint overtime_**.\n\nInitially, I suspected there were other libraries might have caused the issue, since there were several library upgrades that had occurred between the builds. However, by reverting all the library upgrades, and test the Web App by reinstalling one library at the time, the leads were pointing to the lodash library. \n\nSeveral attempts were made to try enabling the profile runs on both browsers, but it did not work, since the browser itself was already unresponsive. Not sure if the information provided here are useful to help with troubleshooting, any suggestions for how to debug the issue on the busy browser would be wonderful too. Thanks!\n\n```\n\"dependencies\": {\n    \"d3\": \"3.5.17\",\n    \"deep-equal\": \"1.0.1\",\n    \"intl\": \"1.2.4\",\n    \"isomorphic-fetch\": \"2.2.1\",\n    \"lodash\": \"4.14.0\",\n    \"material-ui\": \"0.15.2\",\n    \"object-assign\": \"4.1.0\",\n    \"radium\": \"0.18.1\",\n    \"react\": \"15.2.1\",\n    \"react-addons-shallow-compare\": \"15.2.1\",\n    \"react-bootstrap\": \"0.30.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"15.2.1\",\n    \"react-intl\": \"2.1.3\",\n    \"react-motion\": \"0.4.4\",\n    \"react-redux\": \"4.4.5\",\n    \"react-router\": \"2.6.0\",\n    \"react-split-pane\": \"0.1.43\",\n    \"react-tap-event-plugin\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"react-vendor-prefix\": \"0.0.1\",\n    \"react-waypoint\": \"3.1.0\",\n    \"redux\": \"3.5.2\",\n    \"redux-logger\": \"2.6.1\",\n    \"redux-thunk\": \"2.1.0\",\n    \"shallowequal\": \"0.2.2\",\n    \"velocity-react\": \"1.1.5\",\n    \"warning\": \"3.0.0\"\n  }\n```\n",

    "body": "### Introduction:\n\nI'm updating dependencies in my project and after updating lodash from `4.11.1` to `4.14.0` I found out that one of my tests failed.\nI'm using `_.pickBy` like this:\n\n``` js\nconst matchesState = view => view.stateName === stateName;\nconst pickDestinationViews = views => _.pickBy(views, matchesState);\n```\n\n(context: I'm filtering Ionic views but this does not seem to be relevant).\n\nSometimes `view` is `undefined`, but that's supposed to be happening: `views` is an object with string-keyed properties only (`ion\\d+` in fact). And each has an object as value.\nI checked the key (2nd argument of the predicate) and I found out that it's a Symbol. `views` object is not supposed to have any symbols. What's more: in my tests I mock this object and I'm in full control if it has symbols.\n\nI can only spot this problem in PhantomJS 2.1.1 (which happens not to have Symbol implemented). I run [core-js Symbol polyfill](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/modules/es6.symbol.js) for this case.\n\nBTW: I'm aware that my `matchesState` can be implemented with `_.matchesProperty` like this:\n\n``` js\nconst matchesState = _.matchesProperty('stateName', stateName);\n```\n\nbut that's not the point.\n### What I found out:\n\n`_.pickBy` iterates the object keys **and symbols** deeply (at least this is the conclusion I came up with). I'm not sure if it's by design or if it's by accident (maybe it's 80dbd4cbfab6a800668602b955eaa98de9b691c2, maybe it's how lodash interacts with the polyfill)\n\nI run `console.log('getOwnPropertySymbols', Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(Object.prototype));` in Chrome (which implements Symbol) and in PhantomJS. In PhantomJS I got a lot of symbols while in Chrome I got none. I dumped all those symbols to strings and I found out that those are all the symbols I created in the application. Apparently that's how polyfill works.\n\nI modified lodash locally like this:\n\n``` js\nfunction pickBy(object, predicate) {\n  getAllKeysIn(object).forEach(function (propertyOrSymbol) {\n    console.log(propertyOrSymbol + '');\n  });\n  return object == null ? {} : basePickBy(object, getAllKeysIn(object), getIteratee(predicate));\n}\n```\n\nand I saw symbols again. I think the problem may be in `getSymbolsIn`. `keysIn` which has the same responsibility as `getSymbolsIn` have some additional checks with `hasOwnProperty`. `getSymbolsIn` just uses `while` if there are no native symbols getter. Polyfill gives `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols` which lodash probably uses. I'm falling short in knowledge to debug it deeper.\n\nI'm concerned about whether `_.pickBy` should reach as deep as `Object.prototype` when it gets symbols (supposing it's by design).\n`_.pickBy` does not reach ownProperties of `ObjectPrototype` (probably because of how `keysIn` is implemented).\n",

    "body": "I'm using lodash to write something like SQL requests to large log files: the main program writes various logs in the json format, then the file is read and parsed with `JSON.parse` and the result is fed to lodash. This gives me some insight into how the program performs. The approach is somewhat similar to collecting telemetry.\n\nHere is an example of the logs file:\n\n```\n...\n{ \"a\": 1, \"b\": 2 },\n{ \"a\": 2, \"b\": 3 },\n...\n```\n\nHere is an example of my lodash queries:\n\n``` js\n_(data)\n  .filter(x => x.a > 0)\n  .countBy(\"b\")\n  ...\n```\n\nThe weak point in this approach is `JSON.parse` - it doesn't work well with > 1 GB files because it needs to have the entire file in memory. The solution looks simple: since the first query is usually a `filter` which picks a tiny subset of all the records, the json file can abstracted with an iterator. However it seems that lodash doesn't work with iterators:\n\n``` js\n> lodash = require(\"lodash\"); lodash.VERSION\n'4.14.0'\n> G = function * () { yield * [1, 2, 3]; }\n[Function]\n> [...G()]\n[ 1, 2, 3 ]\n> lodash(G()).sum()\n0\n> lodash(G()).map(x => -x).value()\n[]\n```\n\nIt's also not clear to me how to implement a custom data source for lodash, to make it work with all these `map` and `filter` functions.\n",

    "body": "I realize this has been asked twice: \n- https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/304\n\nIt's still unclear to me how `runInContext` fixes the local references problem. In my project, I want to simulate input changes and count autocomplete calls. \n\n``` js\n// form.js\n\nimport { debounce } from \"lodash\"\n\nclass Form extends Component {\n  componentWillMount () {\n    this.search = debounce(this.search, 300)\n  }\n\n  search(query) {\n    this.props.searchUsers(query)\n  }\n\n  onChange(ev) {\n    this.search(ev.target.value)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n// form-test.js\n\nimport sinon from \"sinon\"\nimport { runInContext } from \"lodash\"\nimport Form from \"./form\"\n\nit(\"should debounce autocomplete\", () => {\n  const clock = sinon.useFakeTimers()\n\n  // runInContext somehow?\n\n  clock.restore()\n})\n```\n\nWouldn't `runInContext` create a new lodash instance? How would my component use that instance? \n\nI realize I could pass `debounce` in as a function property, stub it out, and re-implement debounce, but the purpose of the black box test is to make sure nobody removes the debouncing logic in the future. \n\nTo fix the problem, I used the `debounce` npm package instead. \n\n``` js\nimport debounce from \"debounce\"\n```\n\nI hope this makes sense. Also, hopefully this will help others who search \"sinon\" and get confused about `runInContext`. \n",

    "body": "Hi there!  While upgrading code-dot-org from lodash 3.10.0 to 4.13.1 I ran across a change to `_.debounce` in [4.11.1](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v4111) that broke [some of our tests](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/staging/apps/test/unit/netsim/NetSimTable.js#L568):\n\n> Ensured `_.debounce` doesn’t immediately call `func` when `wait` is `0`\n\nTo elaborate, `_.debounce(func, 0)` now behaves like `setTimeout(func, 0)`.\n\n``` javascript\nlet func = sinon.spy();\n\n// Under 4.11.0\n_.debounce(func, 0)();\nexpect(spy.callCount).to.equal(1);\n\n// Under 4.11.1\n_.debounce(func, 0)();\nexpect(spy.callCount).to.equal(0);\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  expect(spy.callCount).to.equal(1);\n}, 0);\n```\n\nIt's entirely possible that this means my tests are badly written; we definitely _should_ be using `lolex` for this stuff, but there [are still problems with getting `lodash` to use the replaced window.Date object in tests](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/issues/343#issuecomment-233666906).  So instead, I've turned my debounce/throttle waits down to zero and let most of my tests run serially.  After this change, I had to add additional `setTimeout(_, 0)` calls to my tests.\n\nI'm not entirely opposed to this change, but I was irritated that a patch version broke our tests, and that neither the details of this particular behavior nor the behavior change at 4.11.1 [have been documented](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/doc/README.md#_debouncefunc-wait0-options-optionsleadingfalse-optionsmaxwait-optionstrailingtrue).  I'm opening this issue to get a discussion going around why this change was made in a patch version, whether it's really the ideal behavior for `_.debounce`, and to get the documentation updated to describe the spec'd behavior of `_.debounce` when `wait` is zero.\n\nTagging @jdalton and @b3nj4m who introduced the 'breaking' change.\n\nThanks! -Brad\n",

    "body": "I searched the grounds here but couldn't find a similar request.\n\n`toRange(...)` is for casting a number from one range to another. I've bumped into this method mainly while working with audio/music and 3D graphics, and I've found it very useful.\n\nProposed syntax is `toRange(number, fromLower, fromUpper, toLower, toUpper)`.\n\nHere are some example uses:\n- Casting periodic values to a positive range: `const height = _.toRange(Math.sin(x), -1, 1, 0, window.innerHeight)`\n- Translate the mouse's position into a color parameter: `const hueShift = _.toRange(mouseX, 0, window.innerWidth, -10, 10)`\n- Setting a boosting `GainNode`'s gain value from an `<input type=\"range\" min=\"1\" max=\"10\" />`: `boostGain.value = _.toRange(input.value, input.min, input.max, 1, MAX_GAIN)`\n\nI think it would be quite handy functional style:\n\n``` js\nimport { toRange, mean } from 'lodash/fp'\n\nconst toWidth = toRange(0, window.innerWidth)\nconst sinToWidth = toWidth(-1, 1)\nconst numKeyToWidth = toWidth(48, 57)\n\nconst toReviewScore = toRange(1, 6)\nconst avgThumbsUpDownToScore = toReviewScore(-1, 1)\nconst movieScore = avgThumbsUpDownToScore(mean(thumbsUpDown))\n```\n\nExample implementations:\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10756313/javascript-jquery-map-a-range-of-numbers-to-another-range-of-numbers#23202637\n- http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Map_range#JavaScript\n\nI am unsure how nisched a problem this is, so it would be interesting to hear thoughts on this!\n",

I wish to reliably compare names on credit cards, which have no diacritics, and names defined by users, which may have diacritics.\n\nI mean something between `_.deburr` as it is now and [FGRibreau/node-unidecode](https://github.com/FGRibreau/node-unidecode) which is an overkill, especially for front-end use cases.\n#1430 may be related.\n",

Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.\n\nDo you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests?

I can do it like this:\n\n``` js\nvar is5 = _.partial(_.eq, 5);\n```\n\nBut why not have an even more convenient method: `_.is`\n\n``` js\nvar is5 = _.is(5);\n```\n\nAnd maybe if passing more values you can create an alternative:\n\n``` js\nvar is1or2or3 = _.is(1, 2, 3);\n```\n",

    "body": "Firstly, sorry for making this an issue - it is more of a question but I wasn't sure where else to put it.  There are three questions:\n\n1) I made a few potential additions: `_.intersperse` and `_.mapMaybe`, both based on the haskell functions of the same names:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction squareEven(v) { if (_.isEven(v)) return v * v; } // undefined (not falsy) return as \"skip\".\n_.intersperse([0, 1, 2], 9) // => [0, 9, 1, 9, 2]\n_.mapMaybe([0, 1, 2], squareEven) // => [0, 4]\n```\n\nI read the article on making issues to collect votes for feature requests.  Is it the same or a similar procedure for \"unsolicited\" new features with implementations and tests?  Do I just make a pull request, or first do something to gague desire for the feature?\n\n2) I looked at making a pull request for these features, but that pull request seems to still include d30e41e, which was already integrated - I'm not sure why or how to stop it trying to resubmit that (I merged with the latest upstream version).\n\n3) As the two new features are different, I put them in separate branches, with the intention to make them both separate pull requests.  However, this causes an issue with tests.  They both modify the `lodash methods` test module, increasing the number of expected \"falsy\" and \"array return\" tests by two.  Individually that is fine, but collectively that should be an increase of four.  Woudl it be better to combine them and submit all together?  Or do them very sequentially?\n\nFor reference, the changes I am talking about are here:\n\nhttps://github.com/lodash/lodash/compare/master...Y-Less:Branch_intersperse?expand=1\nhttps://github.com/lodash/lodash/compare/master...Y-Less:Branch_mapMaybe?expand=1\n\nI tried twice to get a cleaner version of just my new changes on top of your upstream, but couldn't without just pulling a whole new one and manually inserting the changes.\n",

Example:\n\nChoices: [\nselectedId : 34,\n{object1},\n{object2},\n{object3},\n...\n]\n\nOn cloneDeep(), I do get all the original item cloned but not the root key/value - selectedId: 34\nManually doing this copies all the properties but not with lodash. Is this by design, I am using it incorrectly or a bug? I need the root properties in my arrays because I use the arrays also as objects in some cases.\n\nThanks!\n",

There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.\n\nI recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of uglify-js.\nGiven that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project.

    "body": "Hi:\nI am currently using Lodash in one of my projects and i found that with the set function currently does not support overwriting. For example, if I input `var obj = { '1' : '2' }`  and `_.set(obj,['1','2'],'3')` , i am expecting the '2' in the obj to be overwritten and and obj becomes `{'1':{'2':'3'}}` , but currently no changes are happening currently to the obj. \nSo I propose this modification to this function, add a fifth arg called \"overwrite' default to true. \nand change the function body to : \n`var index = -1,\n          length = path.length,\n          lastIndex = length - 1,\n          nested = object;\n\n```\n  while (nested != null && ++index < length) {\n    var key = toKey(path[index]);\n    if (isObject(nested)) {\n      var newValue = value;\n      if (index != lastIndex) {\n        var objValue = nested[key];\n        newValue = customizer ? customizer(objValue, key, nested) : undefined;\n        if (newValue === undefined) {\n            newValue = objValue == null\n            ?

    "body": "Tested with v4.13.1\n\nI'm curious what lodash's documented behavior is when `_.get()` is given an ambiguous key on a potentially ambiguous object.\n\n```\nconst obj1 = { a: { b: { c: 1 }, 'b.c': 2 }, 'a.b.c': 3 }\n_.get(obj1, 'a.b.c') \n//=> 3\ndelete obj1['a.b.c']\nobj1 \n// => { a: { b: { c: 1 }, 'b.c': 2 } }\n_.get(obj1, 'a.b.c') \n//=> 1\n```\n\nThe behavior becomes most obvious when working with, say, Mongo statements.\n\n```\nconst update = { $set: { 'profile.firstName': 'Bob' } };\n_.get(update, '$set.profile.firstName')\n//=> undefined\n_.get(_.get(update, '$set'), 'profile.firstName');\n//=> 'Bob'\n```\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but the behavior appears to be \"if a root level key matches the query, return it. Otherwise, treat every period as a nested object and return the most deeply nested result of the query.\"\n\nWould more consistent behavior be preferable? Like \"always returns the least nested matching key\"? Otherwise, would more complete documentation about this behavior be desirable?\n\nThanks!\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nECMAScript defines (currently) 7 so-called langage types in JS http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-ecmascript-language-types\n\nUndefined, Null, Boolean, String, Symbol, Number, and Object\n\nAs everybody knows JS has operator `typeof` which is broken as it returns `\"object\"` for null. Also returns `\"function\"` for functions which is OK but I think it would be nice to have something which gives us one of the 7 language types for given value. It would be under `_.typeof` and it would suggest that it's the correct `typeof` that always returns language type.\n\nImplementation would be dead simple:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction(value) {\n    if (_.isNull(value)) {\n        return \"null\";\n    }\n\n    if (_.isFunction(value)) {\n        return \"object\";\n    }\n\n    return typeof value;\n}\n```\n\nOr something equivalent.\n\nI've seen similar request but it's a little different: https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/1845\nIt makes sense but IMO should be under some other name like `_.class`.\n",
