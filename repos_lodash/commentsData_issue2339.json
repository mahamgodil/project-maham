In my case, I needed to have a `key` property defined on React elements for React to be happy. It was natural to have the key be derived from one of the neighboring elements.",

    "body": "I think _.intersperse could be seen the intermediate step in _.join. I could also see a more powerful version of this, probably better called \"interpolate\", where you can pass a function (a, b) => {} that returns the value that goes in between two given values, or simply a static value. I like the more powerful/flexible option, but up to @jdalton how complex he'd want the code to be. I think either way it would still be under 10 lines.",
