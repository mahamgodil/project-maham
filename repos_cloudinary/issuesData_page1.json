Also, mocha's `describe` is used instead of the unnecessary custom one.\r\n\r\n#### What Does This PR Address?\r\n- [ ] GitHub issue (Add reference - #XX)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring\r\n- [ ] New feature\r\n- [X] Bug fix\r\n- [ ] Adds more tests\r\n\r\n#### Are Tests Included?\r\n- [X] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\n#### Reviewer, Please Note:\r\nThis change may seem to be dangerous, but in order to ensure correctness, I'm going to create additional PR to python SDK containing two new specs that I added here: `test/unit/url/sign_url_spec.js:79` and `test/unit/url/sign_url_spec.js:98`.",

    "body": "## Bug report for Cloudinary NPM SDK\r\nThe only reference to `upload_stream` in the documentation is [this example](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#upload_data_stream). It doesn't show up in the [Upload API reference](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#signed_upload_syntax) which means there's no explanation of what the various parameters/options are, what's returned, caveats to its use, etc. I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how to upload a string to a file, ultimately arriving at [an upload stream wrapped in a `Promise`](https://community.cloudinary.com/discussion/349/why-are-some-of-my-uploads-silently-failing-the-first-time-or-two) after reading [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/130). But it was far more confusing than it needed to be.\r\n\r\nNote also that the example in the first link above uses the streamifier library when I think it's possible to just use a normal Node `Readable`. In my case, I was actually able to pass the string I wanted uploaded directly to `.end()`, so I didn't even need to create the stream myself.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have some discussion of asynchronous considerations using streams in the documentation you write for `upload_stream`, even if all you do is mention that stream operations are always asynchronous and point to some MDN docs about how to properly use them. Bonus points for a Promise implementation, or some distillation of [this comment](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/130#issuecomment-417933120).\r\n\r\n## Describe the bug in a sentence or two.\r\nMissing documentation for `upload_stream`\r\n\r\n## Issue Type (Can be multiple)\r\n[ ] Build - Can’t install or import the SDK\r\n[ ] Babel - Babel errors or cross browser issues\r\n[ ] Performance - Performance issues\r\n[ ] Behaviour - Functions aren’t working as expected (Such as generate URL)\r\n[x] Documentation - Inconsistency between the docs and behaviour\r\n[ ] Incorrect Types - For typescript users who are having problems with our d.ts files\r\n[ ] Other (Specify)\r\n",

    "body": "There doesn't seem to be a separate repo for the REST API, so I'm putting this here.\r\n\r\n_Background: I'm using [Deno](https://deno.land/), which gives `error: Uncaught Error: Dynamic require of \"proxy-agent\" is not supported` when I try to import via https://esm.sh/cloudinary@1.36.4. Maybe worth opening a separate issue for that, but my use case is pretty simple, so I'd prefer to just use a simple `fetch` request rather than adding bloat by pulling in a whole SDK._\r\n\r\n## Explain your use case\r\n\r\nI'm trying to [upload a file](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference) via POST request. Everything seems to be working OK, except when the file name contains non-ASCII characters. For example, if `public_id` in my request is \"蜡笔小新\", the `public_id` returned in the response is \"è¡ç¬å°æ°\".\r\n\r\nWhen I run the Node SDK in runkit, I notice it deals gracefully with UTF-8 `public_id`s, but I can't figure out how from skimming the code. Perhaps this should be added to the documentation? Not sure if it counts as a bug per se, but usually I just assume modern web APIs will automatically use UTF-8 as default.\r\n\r\n## Describe the problem you’re trying to solve\r\n\r\nMy code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst config = {\r\n    cloudName: getEnvVar('CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME'),\r\n    apiKey: getEnvVar('CLOUDINARY_API_KEY'),\r\n    secretKey: getEnvVar('CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY'),\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst url = `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${config.cloudName}/image/upload`\r\n\r\nconst opts = {\r\n    public_id: file.name.split('.').slice(0, -1).join('.'),\r\n    timestamp: String(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)),\r\n    // use_filename: true,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// don't use any URL encoding etc. otherwise signature won't work\r\nconst naiveQps = Object.keys(opts).sort().map(k => `${k}=${opts[k as keyof typeof opts]}`).join('&')\r\n\r\nconst signature = toHashString(\r\n    await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-1', new TextEncoder().encode(naiveQps + config.secretKey)),\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst formData = new FormData()\r\n\r\nfor (const [k, v] of Object.entries({\r\n    ...opts,\r\n    file,\r\n    api_key: config.apiKey,\r\n    signature,\r\n})) {\r\n    formData.append(k, v)\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst res = await fetch(url, { method: 'POST', body: formData })\r\nconst data: CloudinaryResponseData = await res.json()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I comment out `public_id` and uncomment `use_filename` under `opts`, the same problem still occurs (for a filename of \"蜡笔小新.gif\").",

This works fine for uploads that upload the whole file at once but for partial uploads, the response is either a completely different object:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    done: false,\r\n    bytes: 5242880,\r\n    kind: 'upload',\r\n    resource_type: 'image',\r\n    public_id: '167d4ed2-c642-439e-b80b-c47ac97d085c/Y-JG-CANON-EOS-R7-0012'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr `UploadApiResponse` but with `done: true` property included. This is not documented in the API nor in the website (AFAIK).\r\n\r\nCould be cool if this was included since it's hard to otherwise handle the responses properly.\r\n\r\n## Issue Type (Can be multiple)\r\n[ ] Build - Can’t install or import the SDK\r\n[ ] Babel - Babel errors or cross browser issues\r\n[ ] Performance - Performance issues\r\n[ ] Behaviour - Functions aren’t working as expected (Such as generate URL)\r\n[x] Documentation - Inconsistency between the docs and behaviour\r\n[x] Incorrect Types - For typescript users who are having problems with our d.ts files\r\n[ ] Other (Specify)\r\n\r\n## Versions and Libraries (fill in the version numbers)\r\nCloudinary_NPM SDK version 1.36.1\r\nNode - v18\r\n",

As you know videos are somehow large so I would like to ask if there was a way that a person change when the timeout error can pop up because videos (eg: a song) can be up to 200 mb and 200mb can't be uploaded just in one minute. Maybe if there is a way you can help I'm looking forward to your help. Thanks.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94197472/162587008-69f745db-4d43-455c-b390-17896c50e580.png)\r\n",

The doc shows passing in the options obj as the first param, then the callback function. \r\n\r\n- However, in the TS type definition for `tags`, it shows that `callback` [is the first param and then options](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/blob/master/types/index.d.ts#L864\r\n). I am trying to use node `util.promisify` for this `api.tags` function so am wondering why Cloudinary has `callback` as the first param. If callback is the second param in `tags`, then I can call `util.promisify` on this method.  \r\n\r\n- Tested by calling `.tags` with callback as first argument and that fails. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Issue Type (Can be multiple)\r\n[ ] Build - Can’t install or import the SDK\r\n[ ] Babel - Babel errors or cross browser issues\r\n[ ] Performance - Performance issues\r\n[ ] Behaviour - Functions aren’t working as expected (Such as generate URL)\r\n[ ] Documentation - Inconsistency between the docs and behaviour\r\n[X] Incorrect Types - For typescript users who are having problems with our d.ts files\r\n[ ] Other (Specify)\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n… if applicable\r\n\r\n## Error screenshots\r\n… if applicable\r\n\r\n## Browsers (if issue relates to UI, else ignore)\r\n[ ] Chrome\r\n[ ] Firefox\r\n[ ] Safari\r\n[ ] Other (Specify)\r\n[ ] All\r\n\r\n## Versions and Libraries (fill in the version numbers)\r\nCloudinary_NPM SDK version\r\nNode - 0.0.0\r\nNPM - 0.0.0\r\n\r\n## Config Files (Please paste the following files if possible)\r\nPackage.json\r\n\r\n## Repository\r\nIf possible, please provide a link to a reproducible repository that showcases the problem\r\n",

I'm happy to help create a PR. However, doing so would take significant time for me.",
