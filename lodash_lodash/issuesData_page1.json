After looking into it, I found this page explaining how to use a modularized version of the individual packages: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43479464/how-to-import-a-single-lodash-function\r\n\r\nAnd then the specific npm package would be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=lodash.isEqual\r\n\r\nI would expect that the modularized versions would be the same as the full repo, but I noticed that some of these packages haven't been updated in a while, and I just wanted to make sure that the modularized versions are fully up to date with the full package.\r\n\r\ntldr: Using individual lodash package, is lodash.clonedeep as updated as installing lodash and using cloneDeep()?",

That would probably pre-empt PRs such as #5229, and simply have more information.\r\n\r\n**Note**: I would propose such a PR, but I haven't found the documentation source in master. The examples in `countBy` source are not the ones included in the documentation, either.\r\n\r\n**Post-note**: what's the current maintenance status of this module?",

    "body": "When trying to create a lodash template with the `variable` option, the expectation is that the compiled function would match [the documentation](https://lodash.com/docs#template), however it appears that the property access documented does not occur. Example:\r\n\r\nInput SVG:\r\n```\r\n<svg width=\"12\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\r\n<path d=\"M4 0C1.7909 0 0 1.79086 0 4V8C0 10.2091 1.7909 12 4 12H8C10.2091 12 12 10.2091 12 8V4C12 1.79086 10.2091 0 8 0H4Z\" fill=\"${fill}\"/>\r\n</svg>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n```js\r\nconst svgFile = readFileSync(file, { encoding: 'utf8' });\r\nconst compileSvg = template(svgFile, { variable: 'data' });\r\n\r\nconsole.log(compileSvg.toString());\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nfunction(data) {\r\nvar __t, __p = '';\r\n__p += '<svg width=\"12\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n<path d=\"M4 0C1.7909 0 0 1.79086 0 4V8C0 10.2091 1.7909 12 4 12H8C10.2091 12 12 10.2091 12 8V4C12 1.79086 10.2091 0 8 0H4Z\" fill=\"' +\r\n((__t = (fill)) == null ? '' : __t) +\r\n'\"/>\\n</svg>\\n';\r\nreturn __p\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that `fill` is not being accessed from `data`, but rather as standalone. Based on the documentation, this is the output expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction(data) {\r\nvar __t, __p = '';\r\n__p += '<svg width=\"12\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n<path d=\"M4 0C1.7909 0 0 1.79086 0 4V8C0 10.2091 1.7909 12 4 12H8C10.2091 12 12 10.2091 12 8V4C12 1.79086 10.2091 0 8 0H4Z\" fill=\"' +\r\n((__t = (data.fill)) == null ? '' : __t) +\r\n'\"/>\\n</svg>\\n';\r\nreturn __p\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, the same lack of property access occurs even without the variable and just using the `with` statement:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction(obj) {\r\nobj || (obj = {});\r\nvar __t, __p = '';\r\nwith (obj) {\r\n__p += '<svg width=\"12\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n<path d=\"M4 0C1.7909 0 0 1.79086 0 4V8C0 10.2091 1.7909 12 4 12H8C10.2091 12 12 10.2091 12 8V4C12 1.79086 10.2091 0 8 0H4Z\" fill=\"' +\r\n((__t = (fill)) == null ? '' : __t) +\r\n'\"/>\\n</svg>\\n';\r\n\r\n}\r\nreturn __p\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this expected? If so, it should be reflected in the documentation, but either way it isn't obvious why the lack of property access.",

Thus, it is both a recommendation from the [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and the [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions) itself to always use credentials that are minimally scoped.\r\n\r\nThis means setting the [top level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) permission as contents: read (usually enough to most actions) or even read-all, and grant any write permission at the [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idpermissions)\r\n\r\nLet me know if that's ok for you and I will open a PR setting permissions on tests.yml.",

    "body": "(Apologies if TypeScript issues should be opened somewhere else, like at DefinitelyTyped.  Happy to open one there if that's the right thing.)\r\n\r\nThe TS types for `flow` and `compose` from `@types/lodash` permit invalid compositions.   Here's a minimal example with `flow`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport flow from 'lodash/fp/flow'\r\n​\r\ndeclare const f1: (n: number) => string\r\ndeclare const f2: (n: string) => boolean\r\n​\r\n// Ok, good\r\nconst g1 = flow(f1, f2)\r\n​\r\n// This should be a type error! f1 is not composable with f1\r\nconst g2 = flow(f1, f1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[TypeScript Playground link to the above example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAcgDYQCYEMDOALBcD0+cAcgKamoVwwRwBm0AxqXACoDKcYS6AngOZQIAVwB2qarWCjMMdEiRwUGHADo22FqNIAPeEmkt5EbXGCZRCeJmF06wRsFKiYAKFCRY9FAHd6QkERlLGx8OjAw3wRXV0pGHigWRhNZegBGAC44AApRLNFhEAAjUigASjgAXgA+OFkoaX5Y0nj0RLhkmXg6ACYs3Kz6xoqauCKICCRSdFEYwjgAeQBrABo4fgnUV07U-jSq7wgfbLo0td6yuaJWbHM67BEkCRK4dGpeMBZSoSgAQnSzJg4KIIPBkuAIJh0EUpnAfMAYNh0tsUvB+D0DnRfCczulLkA)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`flow(f1, f1)` should be a type error, since `(number) => string` isn't composable with `(number) => string`.  `compose(f1, f1)` similarly isn't a type error.  This allows invalid compositions that will likely fail at runtime.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`flow(f1, f1)` is not a type error.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt looks like the the current types don't error because of the [catchall overload](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/lodash/fp.d.ts#L1327).  When none of the strongly typed overloads match, TS uses the catchall, which accepts any argument list of functions.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues and I started using lodash/fp on a new TypeScript project where function composition is an important part of our toolbox.  This issue is a blocker for our using lodash.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm hoping for a solution, I also understand it may not be possible.  In that case I'm just hoping to learn about why the current types are what they are.  I figure there might be some history and backward compatibility concerns that drove the current types.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate: added TS Playground link",

We're using lodash in a government-regulated environment where one of its recently-detected critical-rated vulnerabilities must be mitigated in 30 days, so we're investigating whether patches are likely or if we should quickly move to an alternative.\r\n\r\nThanks",

    "body": "Hello, I am trying to use lodash and I was wondering when we run multiple `_.filter()` against a data set, can we have a array of predicates as a parameter. \r\n\r\nFor example (Current usage) : \r\n```\r\nconst cars = [\r\n  { 'company': 'Honda', 'year': '2019', 'name': 'civic' },\r\n  { 'company': 'Honda', 'year': '2020', 'name': 'civic' },\r\n  { 'company': 'Hyundai', 'year': '2019', 'name': 'elantra' }\r\n];\r\nconst civicFilterResult = _.filter(cars, { 'name': 'civic' }); <----- results for civic\r\nconst elantraFilterResult = _.filter(cars, { 'name': 'elantra' }); <---- results for elantra\r\n```\r\n\r\nRefactored usage : \r\n\r\n```\r\nconst cars = [\r\n  { 'company': 'Honda', 'year': '2019', 'name': 'civic' },\r\n  { 'company': 'Honda', 'year': '2020', 'name': 'civic' },\r\n  { 'company': 'Hyundai', 'year': '2019', 'name': 'elantra' }\r\n];\r\nconst filteredResults = _.filter(cars, [{ 'name': 'civic' }, { 'name': 'elantra' }]); <---- results for civic and elantra\r\n```\r\n**Note**: Keep in mind I don't mean I want `if(name === 'civic' && name === 'elantra')`, I want both of them in separate result sets. \r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\n\r\n- Can the above be achieved in any different way ?\r\n- If we do it the current way is there a performance hit with large data sets like 200 complex collections ? \r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know if something is not clear, I'm relatively new to lodash usage and was wondering if this is something possible. Thanks !\r\n",

    "body": "What is the suggested approach to finding the index of an element in a sorted array of objects? \r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, `findIndex` is not performing a binary search and that is expected. However, currently, there is no straightforward way to find an index of a complex array element. \r\n\r\nHere is a made-up example. Assume the array is sorted and contains thousands of elements. How do I find the index of an element with id 'x' using lodash with optimized binary search? I know I can add a binary search method to my utils file, but for such a common use case, it would make sense for it to be a part of this lib. \r\n```js\r\nconst array = [\r\n   {\r\n      id: 1,\r\n      name: 'James',\r\n   },\r\n   {\r\n      id: 2,\r\n      name: 'Katie',\r\n   }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere was [an attempt to fix this in 2016](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/pull/2427), but still no progress by the end of 2022?

    "body": "My proposal is a new function `_.compare` and it's variants. It should categorize each and all elements from two collections into three arrays regarding whether the element is present in the first collection only, the second collection only or both collections. It's the combination of both differences and the intersection of the two collections, but all done in a single operation.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n```\r\n_.compare([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]);\r\n// => [[1], [4], [2, 3]];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use case:\r\nWhen updating a list of entities in a database: we have the current list state in the database (`var existing`) and the desired list state submitted by the sender (`var request`). My proposal is relevant because:\r\n\r\n- Items in `request` but not in `existing` are new items created by the sender, and should be created in the database;\r\n- Items in `existing` but not in `request` were deleted by the sender, and should be removed from the database;\r\n- Items in both `request` and `existing` may have been edited by the sender, and should be updated in the database.\r\n\r\nTherefore, all elements in both collections will result in an operation, but which operation depends on how the element was categorized.",

This hardly generates 150 mb data per min which should ideally be garbage collected but infact it doesnt and eventually after 5mins ,  memory utilisation goes over 1G.  \r\n\r\nNot sure why there are no memory leaks reported yet for this function or maybe am doing something wrong?\r\n\r\n",
